# Generating Book Cover Art Using Emotion Detected Labels in Classical Literature

## Deriving patterns from the emotional landcape of literary texts between 1800-1920

### Abstract
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an area of computer science associated with using machines to collect, analyze, and categorize the human language. Emotion Detection (also known as Emotion Recognition) is an NLP task which uses data in the form of speeches, images, videos, or text, and matches the input with a classification label. Classification labels are pre-trained using a variety of methods, from keyword matching to deep learning neural networks.
 
Emotion labeling models are commonly based on the organization systems of several psychoanalysts, including Robert Plutchik and Paul Ekman. These models group and characterize emotions into hierarchies, usually identifying six to eight core emotions, e.g. happy, sad, bored, disgusted, angry, surprised, etc. Data scientists and researchers in the NLP field use these lists to train and test datasets.
 
This project assesses if emotionally representative book covers can be accurately and distinctly created using a generative process with the text of the book as the data. Both proprietary and hand crafted APIs are used to analyze emotions found in the corpuses of the 25 high ranking books from Project Gutenberg. In order to avoid copyright issues, all books used are in the public domain, with original publish dates between 1800 and 1925. Multiple emotion recognition models are evaluated for accuracy and value within the literary space. The machine learning models are then compared to human evaluations of emotions. Results indicate that machine learning models are able to adequately predict the emotions in novels and generate supporting book cover art.
 
The final outcome of this project will be printable manuscripts with custom generated covers using analyzed model results. Once the visualizations are built, using D3js, the designs will be imported into InDesign for final production and typesetting. The physical book will contain the text of the original author, as well as accompanying text and diagrams provided from this project.


### Initial Planning and Mind Mapping
Iâ€™m visualizing emotions in Project Gutenberg novels because I want to show how to use machine learning to create data for generative art with contextual meaning and to uncover embedded patterns within revered works of literature.
