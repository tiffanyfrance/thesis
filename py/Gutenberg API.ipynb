      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the\n",
      "commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil\n",
      "forebodings. I arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure\n",
      "my dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success\n",
      "of my undertaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of\n",
      "Petersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which\n",
      "braces my nerves and fills me with delight. Do you understand this\n",
      "feeling? This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards\n",
      "which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes.\n",
      "Inspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent\n",
      "and vivid. I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of\n",
      "frost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the\n",
      "region of beauty and delight. There, Margaret, the sun is for ever\n",
      "visible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a\n",
      "perpetual splendour. There—for with your leave, my sister, I will put\n",
      "some trust in preceding navigators—there snow and frost are banished;\n",
      "and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in\n",
      "wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable\n",
      "globe. Its productions and features may be without example, as the\n",
      "phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered\n",
      "solitudes. What may not be expected in a country of eternal light? I\n",
      "may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may\n",
      "regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this\n",
      "voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever. I\n",
      "shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world\n",
      "never before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by\n",
      "the foot of man. These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to\n",
      "conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this\n",
      "laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little\n",
      "boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his\n",
      "native river. But supposing all these conjectures to be false, you\n",
      "cannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all\n",
      "mankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole\n",
      "to those countries, to reach which at present so many months are\n",
      "requisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at\n",
      "all possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.\n",
      "\n",
      "These reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my\n",
      "letter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me\n",
      "to heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as\n",
      "a steady purpose—a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual\n",
      "eye. This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years. I\n",
      "have read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have\n",
      "been made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean\n",
      "through the seas which surround the pole. You may remember that a\n",
      "history of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the\n",
      "whole of our good Uncle Thomas’ library. My education was neglected,\n",
      "yet I was passionately fond of reading. These volumes were my study\n",
      "day and night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which\n",
      "I had felt, as a child, on learning that my father’s dying injunction\n",
      "had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life.\n",
      "\n",
      "These visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets\n",
      "whose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven. I also\n",
      "became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation;\n",
      "I imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the\n",
      "names of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated. You are well\n",
      "acquainted with my failure and how heavily I bore the disappointment.\n",
      "But just at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and my\n",
      "thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Six years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking. I\n",
      "can, even now, remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this\n",
      "great enterprise. I commenced by inuring my body to hardship. I\n",
      "accompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea;\n",
      "I voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I often\n",
      "worked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my\n",
      "nights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those\n",
      "branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive\n",
      "the greatest practical advantage. Twice I actually hired myself as an\n",
      "under-mate in a Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration. I\n",
      "must own I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second\n",
      "dignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest\n",
      "earnestness, so valuable did he consider my services.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose?\n",
      "My life might have been passed in ease and luxury, but I preferred glory to\n",
      "every enticement that wealth placed in my path. Oh, that some encouraging\n",
      "voice would answer in the affirmative! My courage and my resolution is\n",
      "firm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are often depressed. I am\n",
      "about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the emergencies of which\n",
      "will demand all my fortitude: I am required not only to raise the spirits\n",
      "of others, but sometimes to sustain my own, when theirs are failing.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia. They fly\n",
      "quickly over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in\n",
      "my opinion, far more agreeable than that of an English stagecoach. The\n",
      "cold is not excessive, if you are wrapped in furs—a dress which I have\n",
      "already adopted, for there is a great difference between walking the\n",
      "deck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise\n",
      "prevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins. I have no\n",
      "ambition to lose my life on the post-road between St. Petersburgh and\n",
      "Archangel.\n",
      "\n",
      "I shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and my\n",
      "intention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying the\n",
      "insurance for the owner, and to engage as many sailors as I think necessary\n",
      "among those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing. I do not intend to\n",
      "sail until the month of June; and when shall I return? Ah, dear sister, how\n",
      "can I answer this question? If I succeed, many, many months, perhaps years,\n",
      "will pass before you and I may meet. If I fail, you will see me again soon,\n",
      "or never.\n",
      "\n",
      "Farewell, my dear, excellent Margaret. Heaven shower down blessings on you,\n",
      "and save me, that I may again and again testify my gratitude for all your\n",
      "love and kindness.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "How slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and snow!\n",
      "Yet a second step is taken towards my enterprise. I have hired a\n",
      "vessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors; those whom I have\n",
      "already engaged appear to be men on whom I can depend and are certainly\n",
      "possessed of dauntless courage.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy, and the\n",
      "absence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil, I have no\n",
      "friend, Margaret: when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success, there\n",
      "will be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by disappointment, no\n",
      "one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection. I shall commit my thoughts\n",
      "to paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of\n",
      "feeling. I desire the company of a man who could sympathise with me, whose\n",
      "eyes would reply to mine. You may deem me romantic, my dear sister, but I\n",
      "bitterly feel the want of a friend. I have no one near me, gentle yet\n",
      "courageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose\n",
      "tastes are like my own, to approve or amend my plans. How would such a\n",
      "friend repair the faults of your poor brother! I am too ardent in execution\n",
      "and too impatient of difficulties. But it is a still greater evil to me\n",
      "that I am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild\n",
      "on a common and read nothing but our Uncle Thomas’ books of voyages.\n",
      "At that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own\n",
      "country; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its\n",
      "most important benefits from such a conviction that I perceived the\n",
      "necessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native\n",
      "country. Now I am twenty-eight and am in reality more illiterate than many\n",
      "schoolboys of fifteen. It is true that I have thought more and that my\n",
      "daydreams are more extended and magnificent, but they want (as the painters\n",
      "call it) _keeping;_ and I greatly need a friend who would have sense\n",
      "enough not to despise me as romantic, and affection enough for me to\n",
      "endeavour to regulate my mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on the\n",
      "wide ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen. Yet\n",
      "some feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in these\n",
      "rugged bosoms. My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courage\n",
      "and enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or rather, to word my phrase\n",
      "more characteristically, of advancement in his profession. He is an\n",
      "Englishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices,\n",
      "unsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of\n",
      "humanity. I first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel;\n",
      "finding that he was unemployed in this city, I easily engaged him to assist\n",
      "in my enterprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "The master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the\n",
      "ship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline. This\n",
      "circumstance, added to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage, made\n",
      "me very desirous to engage him. A youth passed in solitude, my best years\n",
      "spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the\n",
      "groundwork of my character that I cannot overcome an intense distaste to\n",
      "the usual brutality exercised on board ship: I have never believed it to be\n",
      "necessary, and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness\n",
      "of heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I felt\n",
      "myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services. I heard\n",
      "of him first in rather a romantic manner, from a lady who owes to him the\n",
      "happiness of her life. This, briefly, is his story. Some years ago he loved\n",
      "a young Russian lady of moderate fortune, and having amassed a considerable\n",
      "sum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the match. He saw\n",
      "his mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in\n",
      "tears, and throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her,\n",
      "confessing at the same time that she loved another, but that he was poor,\n",
      "and that her father would never consent to the union. My generous friend\n",
      "reassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the name of her lover,\n",
      "instantly abandoned his pursuit. He had already bought a farm with his\n",
      "money, on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he\n",
      "bestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his\n",
      "prize-money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young\n",
      "woman’s father to consent to her marriage with her lover. But the old\n",
      "man decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend, who,\n",
      "when he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor returned\n",
      "until he heard that his former mistress was married according to her\n",
      "inclinations. “What a noble fellow!” you will exclaim. He is\n",
      "so; but then he is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a Turk, and a kind\n",
      "of ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conduct\n",
      "the more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy which\n",
      "otherwise he would command.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet do not suppose, because I complain a little or because I can\n",
      "conceive a consolation for my toils which I may never know, that I am\n",
      "wavering in my resolutions. Those are as fixed as fate, and my voyage\n",
      "is only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation. The\n",
      "winter has been dreadfully severe, but the spring promises well, and it\n",
      "is considered as a remarkably early season, so that perhaps I may sail\n",
      "sooner than I expected. I shall do nothing rashly: you know me\n",
      "sufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the\n",
      "safety of others is committed to my care.\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my\n",
      "undertaking. It is impossible to communicate to you a conception of\n",
      "the trembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with which\n",
      "I am preparing to depart. I am going to unexplored regions, to “the\n",
      "land of mist and snow,” but I shall kill no albatross; therefore do not\n",
      "be alarmed for my safety or if I should come back to you as worn and\n",
      "woeful as the “Ancient Mariner.” You will smile at my allusion, but I\n",
      "will disclose a secret. I have often attributed my attachment to, my\n",
      "passionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that\n",
      "production of the most imaginative of modern poets. There is something\n",
      "at work in my soul which I do not understand. I am practically\n",
      "industrious—painstaking, a workman to execute with perseverance and\n",
      "labour—but besides this there is a love for the marvellous, a belief\n",
      "in the marvellous, intertwined in all my projects, which hurries me out\n",
      "of the common pathways of men, even to the wild sea and unvisited\n",
      "regions I am about to explore.\n",
      "\n",
      "But to return to dearer considerations. Shall I meet you again, after\n",
      "having traversed immense seas, and returned by the most southern cape of\n",
      "Africa or America? I dare not expect such success, yet I cannot bear to\n",
      "look on the reverse of the picture. Continue for the present to write to\n",
      "me by every opportunity: I may receive your letters on some occasions when\n",
      "I need them most to support my spirits. I love you very tenderly. \n",

      "its homeward voyage from Archangel; more fortunate than I, who may not\n",

      "floating sheets of ice that continually pass us, indicating the dangers\n",
      "of the region towards which we are advancing, appear to dismay them. We\n",

      "she floated. Our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we\n",

      "\n",
      "About two o’clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out\n",
      "in every direction, vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to\n",
      "have no end. Some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to\n",
      "grow watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly\n",
      "attracted our attention and diverted our solicitude from our own\n",
      "situation. We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by\n",
      "dogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance of half a mile; a\n",
      "being which had the shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature,\n",
      "sat in the sledge and guided the dogs. We watched the rapid progress\n",
      "of the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the\n",
      "distant inequalities of the ice.\n",

      "talking to someone in the sea. It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we\n",
      "had seen before, which had drifted towards us in the night on a large\n",
      "fragment of ice. Only one dog remained alive; but there was a human\n",
      "being within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel.\n",
      "He was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of\n",
      "some undiscovered island, but a European. When I appeared on deck the\n",
      "master said, “Here is our captain, and he will not allow you to perish\n",
      "on the open sea.”\n",

      "On perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a\n",

      "\n",
      "You may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed\n",
      "to me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom I should have\n",
      "supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not\n",
      "have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford. I\n",
      "replied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the\n",
      "northern pole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board.\n",
      "Good God! Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for\n",
      "his safety, your surprise would have been boundless. His limbs were\n",
      "nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and\n",
      "suffering. I never saw a man in so wretched a condition. We attempted\n",
      "to carry him into the cabin, but as soon as he had quitted the fresh\n",
      "air he fainted. We accordingly brought him back to the deck and\n",
      "restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him to\n",
      "swallow a small quantity. As soon as he showed signs of life we\n",
      "wrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the\n",
      "kitchen stove. By slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup,\n",
      "which restored him wonderfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak, and I often\n",
      "feared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding. When he\n",
      "had in some measure recovered, I removed him to my own cabin and\n",
      "attended on him as much as my duty would permit. I never saw a more\n",
      "interesting creature: his eyes have generally an expression of\n",
      "wildness, and even madness, but there are moments when, if anyone\n",
      "performs an act of kindness towards him or does him any the most\n",
      "trifling service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with\n",
      "a beam of benevolence and sweetness that I never saw equalled. But he\n",
      "is generally melancholy and despairing, and sometimes he gnashes his\n",
      "teeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him.\n",
      "\n",
      "When my guest was a little recovered I had great trouble to keep off\n",

      "allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body\n",
      "and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose.\n",
      "Once, however, the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice\n",
      "in so strange a vehicle.\n",
      "\n",
      "His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom, and\n",
      "he replied, “To seek one who fled from me.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then I fancy we have seen him, for the day before we picked you up we\n",

      "\n",
      "This aroused the stranger’s attention, and he asked a multitude of\n",
      "questions concerning the route which the dæmon, as he called him, had\n",

      "people; but you are too considerate to make inquiries.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation; you have\n",
      "benevolently restored me to life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon after this he inquired if I thought that the breaking up of the\n",
      "ice had destroyed the other sledge. I replied that I could not answer\n",
      "with any degree of certainty, for the ice had not broken until near\n",
      "midnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety\n",
      "before that time; but of this I could not judge.\n",
      "\n",
      "From this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the\n",
      "stranger. He manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for\n",
      "the sledge which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain in\n",
      "the cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere.\n",

      "Yet his manners are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all\n",
      "interested in him, although they have had very little communication\n",
      "with him. For my own part, I begin to love him as a brother, and his\n",
      "constant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion. He must\n",

      "noble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant\n",
      "grief? He is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated, and\n",

      "disguise. He entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my\n",
      "eventual success and into every minute detail of the measures I had taken\n",
      "to secure it. I was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the\n",

      "and to say, with all the fervour that warmed me, how gladly I would\n",

      "Such words, you may imagine, strongly excited my curiosity; but the\n",

      "necessary to restore his composure.\n",

      "Having conquered the violence of his feelings, he appeared to despise\n",
      "himself for being the slave of passion; and quelling the dark tyranny of\n",

      "me the history of my earlier years. The tale was quickly told, but it\n",
      "awakened various trains of reflection. I spoke of my desire of finding a\n",
      "friend, of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than\n",
      "had ever fallen to my lot, and expressed my conviction that a man could\n",
      "boast of little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing.\n",

      "ourselves—such a friend ought to be—do not lend his aid to\n",
      "perfectionate our weak and faulty natures. I once had a friend, the most\n",
      "noble of human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting\n",
      "friendship. You have hope, and the world before you, and have no cause for\n",

      "I am by birth a Genevese, and my family is one of the most\n",
      "distinguished of that republic. My ancestors had been for many years\n",
      "counsellors and syndics, and my father had filled several public\n",
      "situations with honour and reputation. He was respected by all who\n",
      "knew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public\n",
      "business. He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the\n",
      "affairs of his country; a variety of circumstances had prevented his\n",
      "marrying early, nor was it until the decline of life that he became a\n",
      "husband and the father of a family.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot\n",
      "refrain from relating them. One of his most intimate friends was a\n",
      "merchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous\n",
      "mischances, into poverty. This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a\n",
      "proud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty\n",
      "and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been\n",
      "distinguished for his rank and magnificence. Having paid his debts,\n",
      "therefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his\n",
      "daughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in\n",
      "wretchedness. My father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship and\n",
      "was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances.\n",
      "He bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct\n",
      "so little worthy of the affection that united them. He lost no time in\n",
      "endeavouring to seek him out, with the hope of persuading him to begin\n",
      "the world again through his credit and assistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself, and it was ten\n",
      "months before my father discovered his abode. Overjoyed at this discovery,\n",
      "he hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street near the\n",
      "Reuss. But when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed him. Beaufort\n",
      "had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes, but\n",
      "it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months, and in\n",
      "the meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a\n",
      "merchant’s house. The interval was, consequently, spent in inaction;\n",
      "his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for\n",
      "reflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end\n",
      "of three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion.\n",
      "\n",
      "His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness, but she saw\n",
      "with despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that\n",
      "there was no other prospect of support. But Caroline Beaufort\n",
      "possessed a mind of an uncommon mould, and her courage rose to support\n",
      "her in her adversity. She procured plain work; she plaited straw and\n",
      "by various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to\n",
      "support life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several months passed in this manner. Her father grew worse; her time\n",
      "was more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence\n",
      "decreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving\n",
      "her an orphan and a beggar. This last blow overcame her, and she knelt\n",
      "by Beaufort’s coffin weeping bitterly, when my father entered the\n",
      "chamber. He came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, who\n",
      "committed herself to his care; and after the interment of his friend he\n",
      "conducted her to Geneva and placed her under the protection of a\n",
      "relation. Two years after this event Caroline became his wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but\n",
      "this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted\n",
      "affection. There was a sense of justice in my father’s upright mind\n",
      "which rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love\n",
      "strongly. Perhaps during former years he had suffered from the\n",
      "late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set\n",
      "a greater value on tried worth. There was a show of gratitude and\n",
      "worship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from the\n",
      "doting fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her\n",
      "virtues and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing\n",
      "her for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace\n",
      "to his behaviour to her. Everything was made to yield to her wishes\n",
      "and her convenience. He strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic is\n",
      "sheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind and to surround her\n",
      "with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and\n",
      "benevolent mind. Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto\n",
      "constant spirit, had been shaken by what she had gone through. During\n",
      "the two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had\n",
      "gradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately after\n",
      "their union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy, and the change\n",
      "of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders,\n",
      "as a restorative for her weakened frame.\n",
      "\n",
      "From Italy they visited Germany and France. I, their eldest child, was born\n",
      "at Naples, and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles. I remained\n",
      "for several years their only child. Much as they were attached to each\n",
      "other, they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very\n",
      "mine of love to bestow them upon me. My mother’s tender caresses and\n",
      "my father’s smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my\n",
      "first recollections. I was their plaything and their idol, and something\n",
      "better—their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on\n",
      "them by Heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was in\n",
      "their hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulfilled\n",
      "their duties towards me. With this deep consciousness of what they owed\n",
      "towards the being to which they had given life, added to the active spirit\n",
      "of tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined that while during\n",
      "every hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience, of charity,\n",
      "and of self-control, I was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but\n",
      "one train of enjoyment to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a long time I was their only care. My mother had much desired to have a\n",
      "daughter, but I continued their single offspring. When I was about five\n",
      "years old, while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of Italy, they\n",
      "passed a week on the shores of the Lake of Como. Their benevolent\n",
      "disposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor. This, to my\n",
      "mother, was more than a duty; it was a necessity, a\n",
      "passion—remembering what she had suffered, and how she had been\n",
      "relieved—for her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the\n",
      "afflicted. During one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a vale\n",
      "attracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate, while the number\n",
      "of half-clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worst\n",
      "shape. One day, when my father had gone by himself to Milan, my mother,\n",
      "accompanied by me, visited this abode. She found a peasant and his wife,\n",
      "hard working, bent down by care and labour, distributing a scanty meal to\n",
      "five hungry babes. Among these there was one which attracted my mother far\n",
      "above all the rest. She appeared of a different stock. The four others were\n",

      "indiscriminately. I confess that neither the structure of languages,\n",

      "lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery. He might dissect,\n",
      "anatomise, and give names; but, not to speak of a final cause, causes\n",

      "ignorantly I had repined.\n",

      "But here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew\n",
      "more. I took their word for all that they averred, and I became their\n",

      "century; but while I followed the routine of education in the schools of\n",

      "Clerval; these were “old familiar faces,” but I believed myself\n",
      "totally unfitted for the company of strangers. Such were my reflections as\n",
      "I commenced my journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits and hopes rose. I\n",
      "ardently desired the acquisition of knowledge. I had often, when at home,\n",
      "thought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place and had\n",
      "longed to enter the world and take my station among other human beings. \n",
      "Now my desires were complied with, and it would, indeed, have been folly to\n",
      "repent.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my\n",
      "journey to Ingolstadt, which was long and fatiguing. At length the\n",
      "high white steeple of the town met my eyes. I alighted and was\n",
      "conducted to my solitary apartment to spend the evening as I pleased.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning I delivered my letters of introduction and paid a visit to\n",
      "some of the principal professors. Chance—or rather the evil\n",
      "influence, the Angel of Destruction, which asserted omnipotent sway over me\n",
      "from the moment I turned my reluctant steps from my father’s\n",
      "door—led me first to M. Krempe, professor of natural philosophy. He\n",
      "was an uncouth man, but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science. He\n",
      "asked me several questions concerning my progress in the different branches\n",
      "of science appertaining to natural philosophy. I replied carelessly, and\n",
      "partly in contempt, mentioned the names of my alchemists as the principal\n",
      "authors I had studied. The professor stared. “Have you,” he\n",
      "said, “really spent your time in studying such nonsense?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I replied in the affirmative. “Every minute,” continued M. Krempe with\n",
      "warmth, “every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly\n",
      "and entirely lost. You have burdened your memory with exploded systems\n",
      "and useless names. Good God! In what desert land have you lived,\n",
      "where no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which you\n",
      "have so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as musty as they\n",
      "are ancient? I little expected, in this enlightened and scientific\n",
      "age, to find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus. My dear\n",
      "sir, you must begin your studies entirely anew.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So saying, he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several books\n",
      "treating of natural philosophy which he desired me to procure, and\n",
      "dismissed me after mentioning that in the beginning of the following\n",
      "week he intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural\n",
      "philosophy in its general relations, and that M. Waldman, a fellow\n",
      "professor, would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he\n",
      "omitted.\n",
      "\n",
      "I returned home not disappointed, for I have said that I had long\n",
      "considered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated; but I\n",
      "returned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any\n",
      "shape. M. Krempe was a little squat man with a gruff voice and a\n",
      "repulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in\n",
      "favour of his pursuits. In rather a too philosophical and connected a\n",
      "strain, perhaps, I have given an account of the conclusions I had come\n",
      "to concerning them in my early years. As a child I had not been\n",
      "content with the results promised by the modern professors of natural\n",
      "science. With a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my\n",
      "extreme youth and my want of a guide on such matters, I had retrod the\n",
      "steps of knowledge along the paths of time and exchanged the\n",
      "discoveries of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchemists.\n",
      "Besides, I had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy.\n",
      "It was very different when the masters of the science sought\n",
      "immortality and power; such views, although futile, were grand; but now\n",
      "the scene was changed. The ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit\n",
      "itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in\n",
      "science was chiefly founded. I was required to exchange chimeras of\n",
      "boundless grandeur for realities of little worth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such were my reflections during the first two or three days of my\n",
      "residence at Ingolstadt, which were chiefly spent in becoming\n",
      "acquainted with the localities and the principal residents in my new\n",
      "abode. But as the ensuing week commenced, I thought of the information\n",
      "which M. Krempe had given me concerning the lectures. And although I\n",
      "could not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver\n",
      "sentences out of a pulpit, I recollected what he had said of M.\n",
      "Waldman, whom I had never seen, as he had hitherto been out of town.\n",
      "\n",
      "Partly from curiosity and partly from idleness, I went into the lecturing\n",
      "room, which M. Waldman entered shortly after. This professor was very\n",
      "unlike his colleague. He appeared about fifty years of age, but with an\n",
      "aspect expressive of the greatest benevolence; a few grey hairs covered his\n",
      "temples, but those at the back of his head were nearly black. His person\n",
      "was short but remarkably erect and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard.\n",
      "He began his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry and\n",
      "the various improvements made by different men of learning, pronouncing\n",
      "with fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers. He then took\n",
      "a cursory view of the present state of the science and explained many of\n",
      "its elementary terms. After having made a few preparatory experiments, he\n",
      "concluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of which I\n",
      "shall never forget:\n",
      "\n",
      "“The ancient teachers of this science,” said he,\n",
      "“promised impossibilities and performed nothing. The modern masters\n",
      "promise very little; they know that metals cannot be transmuted and that\n",
      "the elixir of life is a chimera but these philosophers, whose hands seem\n",
      "only made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the microscope or\n",
      "crucible, have indeed performed miracles. They penetrate into the recesses\n",
      "of nature and show how she works in her hiding-places. They ascend into the\n",
      "heavens; they have discovered how the blood circulates, and the nature of\n",
      "the air we breathe. They have acquired new and almost unlimited powers;\n",
      "they can command the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even\n",
      "mock the invisible world with its own shadows.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Such were the professor’s words—rather let me say such the words of\n",
      "the fate—enounced to destroy me. As he went on I felt as if my soul\n",
      "were grappling with a palpable enemy; one by one the various keys were\n",
      "touched which formed the mechanism of my being; chord after chord was\n",
      "sounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, one conception,\n",
      "one purpose. So much has been done, exclaimed the soul of\n",
      "Frankenstein—more, far more, will I achieve; treading in the steps\n",
      "already marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and\n",
      "unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.\n",
      "\n",
      "I closed not my eyes that night. My internal being was in a state of\n",
      "insurrection and turmoil; I felt that order would thence arise, but I\n",
      "had no power to produce it. By degrees, after the morning’s dawn,\n",
      "sleep came. I awoke, and my yesternight’s thoughts were as a dream.\n",
      "There only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and to\n",
      "devote myself to a science for which I believed myself to possess a\n",
      "natural talent. On the same day I paid M. Waldman a visit. His\n",
      "manners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public,\n",
      "for there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which in\n",
      "his own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness. I\n",
      "gave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as I had\n",
      "given to his fellow professor. He heard with attention the little\n",
      "narration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of Cornelius\n",
      "Agrippa and Paracelsus, but without the contempt that M. Krempe had\n",
      "exhibited. He said that “These were men to whose indefatigable zeal\n",
      "modern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their\n",
      "knowledge. They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new names\n",
      "and arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a\n",
      "great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light. The\n",
      "labours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever\n",
      "fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind.” I\n",
      "listened to his statement, which was delivered without any presumption\n",
      "or affectation, and then added that his lecture had removed my\n",
      "prejudices against modern chemists; I expressed myself in measured\n",
      "terms, with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his\n",
      "instructor, without letting escape (inexperience in life would have\n",
      "made me ashamed) any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended\n",
      "labours. I requested his advice concerning the books I ought to\n",
      "procure.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am happy,” said M. Waldman, “to have gained a\n",
      "disciple; and if your application equals your ability, I have no doubt of\n",
      "your success. Chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the\n",
      "greatest improvements have been and may be made; it is on that account that\n",
      "I have made it my peculiar study; but at the same time, I have not\n",
      "neglected the other branches of science. A man would make but a very sorry\n",
      "chemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge alone. If your\n",
      "wish is to become really a man of science and not merely a petty\n",
      "experimentalist, I should advise you to apply to every branch of natural\n",
      "philosophy, including mathematics.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He then took me into his laboratory and explained to me the uses of his\n",
      "various machines, instructing me as to what I ought to procure and\n",
      "promising me the use of his own when I should have advanced far enough in\n",
      "the science not to derange their mechanism. He also gave me the list of\n",
      "books which I had requested, and I took my leave.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus ended a day memorable to me; it decided my future destiny.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "From this day natural philosophy, and particularly chemistry, in the\n",
      "most comprehensive sense of the term, became nearly my sole occupation.\n",
      "I read with ardour those works, so full of genius and discrimination,\n",
      "which modern inquirers have written on these subjects. I attended the\n",
      "lectures and cultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the\n",
      "university, and I found even in M. Krempe a great deal of sound sense\n",
      "and real information, combined, it is true, with a repulsive\n",
      "physiognomy and manners, but not on that account the less valuable. In\n",
      "M. Waldman I found a true friend. His gentleness was never tinged by\n",
      "dogmatism, and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and\n",
      "good nature that banished every idea of pedantry. In a thousand ways\n",
      "he smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse\n",
      "inquiries clear and facile to my apprehension. My application was at\n",
      "first fluctuating and uncertain; it gained strength as I proceeded and\n",
      "soon became so ardent and eager that the stars often disappeared in the\n",
      "light of morning whilst I was yet engaged in my laboratory.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that my progress\n",
      "was rapid. My ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students, and\n",
      "my proficiency that of the masters. Professor Krempe often asked me,\n",
      "with a sly smile, how Cornelius Agrippa went on, whilst M. Waldman\n",
      "expressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress. Two years\n",
      "passed in this manner, during which I paid no visit to Geneva, but was\n",
      "engaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries which I\n",
      "hoped to make. None but those who have experienced them can conceive\n",
      "of the enticements of science. In other studies you go as far as\n",
      "others have gone before you, and there is nothing more to know; but in\n",
      "a scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder.\n",
      "A mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must\n",
      "infallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study; and I, who\n",
      "continually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and was\n",
      "solely wrapped up in this, improved so rapidly that at the end of two\n",
      "years I made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical\n",
      "instruments, which procured me great esteem and admiration at the\n",
      "university. When I had arrived at this point and had become as well\n",
      "acquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as\n",
      "depended on the lessons of any of the professors at Ingolstadt, my\n",
      "residence there being no longer conducive to my improvements, I thought\n",
      "of returning to my friends and my native town, when an incident\n",
      "happened that protracted my stay.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was\n",
      "the structure of the human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued with\n",
      "life. Whence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed?\n",
      "It was a bold question, and one which has ever been considered as a\n",
      "mystery; yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming\n",
      "acquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our\n",
      "inquiries. I revolved these circumstances in my mind and determined\n",
      "thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of\n",
      "natural philosophy which relate to physiology. Unless I had been\n",
      "animated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to this\n",
      "study would have been irksome and almost intolerable. To examine the\n",
      "causes of life, we must first have recourse to death. I became\n",
      "acquainted with the science of anatomy, but this was not sufficient; I\n",
      "must also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body.\n",
      "In my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my\n",
      "mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors. I do not ever\n",
      "remember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared\n",
      "the apparition of a spirit. Darkness had no effect upon my fancy, and\n",
      "a churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of\n",
      "life, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength, had become\n",
      "food for the worm. Now I was led to examine the cause and progress of\n",
      "this decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and\n",
      "charnel-houses. My attention was fixed upon every object the most\n",
      "insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings. I saw how the\n",
      "fine form of man was degraded and wasted; I beheld the corruption of\n",
      "death succeed to the blooming cheek of life; I saw how the worm\n",
      "inherited the wonders of the eye and brain. I paused, examining and\n",
      "analysing all the minutiae of causation, as exemplified in the change\n",
      "from life to death, and death to life, until from the midst of this\n",
      "darkness a sudden light broke in upon me—a light so brilliant and\n",
      "wondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the immensity\n",
      "of the prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised that among so\n",
      "many men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same\n",
      "science, that I alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a\n",
      "secret.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, I am not recording the vision of a madman. The sun does not\n",
      "more certainly shine in the heavens than that which I now affirm is\n",
      "true. Some miracle might have produced it, yet the stages of the\n",
      "discovery were distinct and probable. After days and nights of\n",
      "incredible labour and fatigue, I succeeded in discovering the cause of\n",
      "generation and life; nay, more, I became myself capable of bestowing\n",
      "animation upon lifeless matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The astonishment which I had at first experienced on this discovery\n",
      "soon gave place to delight and rapture. After so much time spent in\n",
      "painful labour, to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the\n",
      "most gratifying consummation of my toils. But this discovery was so\n",
      "great and overwhelming that all the steps by which I had been\n",
      "progressively led to it were obliterated, and I beheld only the result.\n",
      "What had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation\n",
      "of the world was now within my grasp. Not that, like a magic scene, it\n",
      "all opened upon me at once: the information I had obtained was of a\n",
      "nature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as I should point them\n",
      "towards the object of my search than to exhibit that object already\n",
      "accomplished. I was like the Arabian who had been buried with the dead\n",
      "and found a passage to life, aided only by one glimmering and seemingly\n",
      "ineffectual light.\n",
      "\n",
      "I see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes\n",
      "express, my friend, that you expect to be informed of the secret with\n",
      "which I am acquainted; that cannot be; listen patiently until the end\n",
      "of my story, and you will easily perceive why I am reserved upon that\n",
      "subject. I will not lead you on, unguarded and ardent as I then was,\n",
      "to your destruction and infallible misery. Learn from me, if not by my\n",
      "precepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of\n",
      "knowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native town\n",
      "to be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature\n",
      "will allow.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, I hesitated\n",
      "a long time concerning the manner in which I should employ it.\n",
      "Although I possessed the capacity of bestowing animation, yet to\n",
      "prepare a frame for the reception of it, with all its intricacies of\n",
      "fibres, muscles, and veins, still remained a work of inconceivable\n",
      "difficulty and labour. I doubted at first whether I should attempt the\n",
      "creation of a being like myself, or one of simpler organization; but my\n",
      "imagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me to\n",
      "doubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and wonderful\n",
      "as man. The materials at present within my command hardly appeared\n",
      "adequate to so arduous an undertaking, but I doubted not that I should\n",
      "ultimately succeed. I prepared myself for a multitude of reverses; my\n",
      "operations might be incessantly baffled, and at last my work be\n",
      "imperfect, yet when I considered the improvement which every day takes\n",
      "place in science and mechanics, I was encouraged to hope my present\n",
      "attempts would at least lay the foundations of future success. Nor\n",
      "could I consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any\n",
      "argument of its impracticability. It was with these feelings that I\n",
      "began the creation of a human being. As the minuteness of the parts\n",
      "formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my first\n",
      "intention, to make the being of a gigantic stature, that is to say,\n",
      "about eight feet in height, and proportionably large. After having\n",
      "formed this determination and having spent some months in successfully\n",
      "collecting and arranging my materials, I began.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like\n",
      "a hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success. Life and death\n",
      "appeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and\n",
      "pour a torrent of light into our dark world. A new species would bless\n",
      "me as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would\n",
      "owe their being to me. No father could claim the gratitude of his\n",
      "child so completely as I should deserve theirs. Pursuing these\n",
      "reflections, I thought that if I could bestow animation upon lifeless\n",
      "matter, I might in process of time (although I now found it impossible)\n",
      "renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption.\n",
      "\n",
      "These thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my undertaking\n",
      "with unremitting ardour. My cheek had grown pale with study, and my\n",
      "person had become emaciated with confinement. Sometimes, on the very\n",
      "brink of certainty, I failed; yet still I clung to the hope which the\n",
      "next day or the next hour might realise. One secret which I alone\n",
      "possessed was the hope to which I had dedicated myself; and the moon\n",
      "gazed on my midnight labours, while, with unrelaxed and breathless\n",
      "eagerness, I pursued nature to her hiding-places. Who shall conceive\n",
      "the horrors of my secret toil as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps\n",
      "of the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless\n",
      "clay? My limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with the remembrance; but\n",
      "then a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward; I seemed\n",
      "to have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit. It was\n",
      "indeed but a passing trance, that only made me feel with renewed\n",
      "acuteness so soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I had\n",
      "returned to my old habits. I collected bones from charnel-houses and\n",
      "disturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human\n",
      "frame. In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house,\n",
      "and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase,\n",
      "I kept my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting from\n",
      "their sockets in attending to the details of my employment. The\n",
      "dissecting room and the slaughter-house furnished many of my materials;\n",
      "and often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation,\n",
      "whilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, I\n",
      "brought my work near to a conclusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul, in\n",
      "one pursuit. It was a most beautiful season; never did the fields\n",
      "bestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a more luxuriant\n",
      "vintage, but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature. And the\n",
      "same feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also\n",
      "to forget those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom I had\n",
      "not seen for so long a time. I knew my silence disquieted them, and I\n",
      "well remembered the words of my father: “I know that while you are\n",
      "pleased with yourself you will think of us with affection, and we shall\n",

      "spoken, but I did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly to\n",
      "detain me, but I escaped and rushed downstairs. I took refuge in the\n",

      "calm and serene joy. I welcomed my friend, therefore, in the most cordial\n",

      "quick pace, and we soon arrived at my college. I then reflected, and\n",
      "the thought made me shiver, that the creature whom I had left in my\n",
      "apartment might still be there, alive and walking about. I dreaded to\n",
      "behold this monster, but I feared still more that Henry should see him.\n",
      "Entreating him, therefore, to remain a few minutes at the bottom of the\n",

      "cold shivering came over me. I threw the door forcibly open, as\n",
      "children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in\n",
      "waiting for them on the other side; but nothing appeared. I stepped\n",
      "fearfully in: the apartment was empty, and my bedroom was also freed\n",
      "from its hideous guest. I could hardly believe that so great a good\n",
      "fortune could have befallen me, but when I became assured that my enemy\n",
      "had indeed fled, I clapped my hands for joy and ran down to Clerval.\n",
      "\n",
      "We ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast;\n",
      "but I was unable to contain myself. It was not joy only that possessed\n",
      "me; I felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness, and my pulse\n",
      "beat rapidly. I was unable to remain for a single instant in the same\n",
      "place; I jumped over the chairs, clapped my hands, and laughed aloud.\n",
      "Clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival,\n",

      "for so long a journey, and how wretched my sickness would make\n",
      "Elizabeth, he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of my\n",
      "disorder. He knew that I could not have a more kind and attentive\n",

      "\n",
      "But I was in reality very ill, and surely nothing but the unbounded and\n",
      "unremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life.\n",
      "The form of the monster on whom I had bestowed existence was for ever\n",
      "before my eyes, and I raved incessantly concerning him. Doubtless my\n",
      "words surprised Henry; he at first believed them to be the wanderings\n",
      "of my disturbed imagination, but the pertinacity with which I\n",
      "continually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder\n",
      "indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event.\n",
      "\n",
      "By very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses that alarmed and\n",
      "grieved my friend, I recovered. I remember the first time I became\n",
      "capable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure, I\n",
      "perceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that the young\n",
      "buds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window. It was\n",
      "a divine spring, and the season contributed greatly to my\n",
      "convalescence. I felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in\n",

      "through a strange perversity, her mother could not endure her, and\n",

      "this, and when Justine was twelve years of age, prevailed on her mother\n",
      "to allow her to live at our house. The republican institutions of our\n",
      "country have produced simpler and happier manners than those which\n",
      "prevail in the great monarchies that surround it. Hence there is less\n",
      "distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants; and the\n",
      "lower orders, being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners are\n",
      "more refined and moral. A servant in Geneva does not mean the same\n",
      "thing as a servant in France and England. Justine, thus received in\n",
      "our family, learned the duties of a servant, a condition which, in our\n",
      "fortunate country, does not include the idea of ignorance and a\n",
      "sacrifice of the dignity of a human being.\n",

      "glance from Justine could dissipate it, for the same reason that\n",
      "Ariosto gives concerning the beauty of Angelica—she looked so\n",

      "which she had at first intended. This benefit was fully repaid;\n",
      "Justine was the most grateful little creature in the world: I do not\n",
      "mean that she made any professions I never heard one pass her lips, but\n",
      "you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress.\n",

      "\n",
      "“One by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with the\n",
      "exception of her neglected daughter, was left childless. The\n",
      "conscience of the woman was troubled; she began to think that the\n",
      "deaths of her favourites was a judgement from heaven to chastise her\n",
      "partiality. She was a Roman Catholic; and I believe her confessor\n",
      "confirmed the idea which she had conceived. Accordingly, a few months\n",
      "after your departure for Ingolstadt, Justine was called home by her\n",
      "repentant mother. Poor girl! She wept when she quitted our house; she\n",
      "was much altered since the death of my aunt; grief had given softness\n",
      "and a winning mildness to her manners, which had before been remarkable\n",
      "for vivacity. Nor was her residence at her mother’s house of a nature\n",
      "to restore her gaiety. The poor woman was very vacillating in her\n",
      "repentance. She sometimes begged Justine to forgive her unkindness,\n",
      "but much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her\n",
      "brothers and sister. Perpetual fretting at length threw Madame Moritz\n",
      "into a decline, which at first increased her irritability, but she is\n",
      "now at peace for ever. She died on the first approach of cold weather,\n",
      "at the beginning of this last winter. Justine has just returned to us;\n",
      "and I assure you I love her tenderly. She is very clever and gentle,\n",

      "my convalescence had commenced, and proceeded regularly. In another\n",
      "fortnight I was able to leave my chamber.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce Clerval to the\n",
      "several professors of the university. In doing this, I underwent a\n",
      "kind of rough usage, ill befitting the wounds that my mind had\n",
      "sustained. Ever since the fatal night, the end of my labours, and the\n",
      "beginning of my misfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy even\n",
      "to the name of natural philosophy. When I was otherwise quite restored\n",
      "to health, the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony\n",
      "of my nervous symptoms. Henry saw this, and had removed all my\n",
      "apparatus from my view. He had also changed my apartment; for he\n",
      "perceived that I had acquired a dislike for the room which had\n",
      "previously been my laboratory. But these cares of Clerval were made of\n",
      "no avail when I visited the professors. M. Waldman inflicted torture\n",
      "when he praised, with kindness and warmth, the astonishing progress I\n",
      "had made in the sciences. He soon perceived that I disliked the\n",
      "subject; but not guessing the real cause, he attributed my feelings to\n",
      "modesty, and changed the subject from my improvement, to the science\n",
      "itself, with a desire, as I evidently saw, of drawing me out. What\n",
      "could I do? He meant to please, and he tormented me. I felt as if he\n",
      "had placed carefully, one by one, in my view those instruments which\n",
      "were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death. I\n",
      "writhed under his words, yet dared not exhibit the pain I felt.\n",
      "Clerval, whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the\n",
      "sensations of others, declined the subject, alleging, in excuse, his\n",
      "total ignorance; and the conversation took a more general turn. I\n",
      "thanked my friend from my heart, but I did not speak. I saw plainly\n",
      "that he was surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret from\n",
      "me; and although I loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence\n",
      "that knew no bounds, yet I could never persuade myself to confide in\n",
      "him that event which was so often present to my recollection, but which\n",

      "the fellow!” cried he; “why, M. Clerval, I assure you he has\n",
      "outstript us all. Ay, stare if you please; but it is nevertheless true. A\n",
      "youngster who, but a few years ago, believed in Cornelius Agrippa as firmly\n",
      "as in the gospel, has now set himself at the head of the university; and if\n",
      "he is not soon pulled down, we shall all be out of countenance.—Ay,\n",
      "ay,” continued he, observing my face expressive of suffering,\n",
      "“M. Frankenstein is modest; an excellent quality in a young man.\n",

      "Clerval had never sympathised in my tastes for natural science; and his\n",
      "literary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me. He\n",
      "came to the university with the design of making himself complete\n",
      "master of the oriental languages, and thus he should open a field for\n",
      "the plan of life he had marked out for himself. Resolved to pursue no\n",
      "inglorious career, he turned his eyes toward the East, as affording\n",
      "scope for his spirit of enterprise. The Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit\n",
      "languages engaged his attention, and I was easily induced to enter on\n",
      "the same studies. Idleness had ever been irksome to me, and now that I\n",
      "wished to fly from reflection, and hated my former studies, I felt\n",
      "great relief in being the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found not\n",
      "only instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists. I\n",
      "did not, like him, attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects, for\n",
      "I did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporary\n",
      "amusement. I read merely to understand their meaning, and they well\n",
      "repaid my labours. Their melancholy is soothing, and their joy\n",
      "elevating, to a degree I never experienced in studying the authors of\n",
      "any other country. When you read their writings, life appears to\n",
      "consist in a warm sun and a garden of roses,—in the smiles and frowns\n",
      "of a fair enemy, and the fire that consumes your own heart. How\n",
      "different from the manly and heroical poetry of Greece and Rome!\n",

      "Summer passed away in these occupations, and my return to Geneva was\n",
      "fixed for the latter end of autumn; but being delayed by several\n",
      "accidents, winter and snow arrived, the roads were deemed impassable,\n",
      "and my journey was retarded until the ensuing spring. I felt this\n",
      "delay very bitterly; for I longed to see my native town and my beloved\n",

      "unwillingness to leave Clerval in a strange place, before he had become\n",
      "acquainted with any of its inhabitants. The winter, however, was spent\n",

      "personal farewell to the country I had so long inhabited. I acceded\n",
      "with pleasure to this proposition: I was fond of exercise, and Clerval\n",
      "had always been my favourite companion in the ramble of this nature\n",
      "that I had taken among the scenes of my native country.\n",
      "\n",
      "We passed a fortnight in these perambulations: my health and spirits\n",
      "had long been restored, and they gained additional strength from the\n",
      "salubrious air I breathed, the natural incidents of our progress, and\n",
      "the conversation of my friend. Study had before secluded me from the\n",
      "intercourse of my fellow-creatures, and rendered me unsocial; but\n",
      "Clerval called forth the better feelings of my heart; he again taught\n",
      "me to love the aspect of nature, and the cheerful faces of children.\n",
      "Excellent friend! how sincerely you did love me, and endeavour to\n",
      "elevate my mind until it was on a level with your own. A selfish\n",
      "pursuit had cramped and narrowed me, until your gentleness and\n",
      "affection warmed and opened my senses; I became the same happy creature\n",

      "When happy, inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most\n",

      "ecstasy. The present season was indeed divine; the flowers of spring\n",
      "bloomed in the hedges, while those of summer were already in bud. I\n",

      "Henry rejoiced in my gaiety, and sincerely sympathised in my feelings: he\n",
      "exerted himself to amuse me, while he expressed the sensations that filled\n",
      "his soul. The resources of his mind on this occasion were truly\n",
      "astonishing: his conversation was full of imagination; and very often, in\n",
      "imitation of the Persian and Arabic writers, he invented tales of wonderful\n",
      "fancy and passion. At other times he repeated my favourite poems, or drew\n",

      "returning; and then we discovered that William and Ernest, who had gone\n",
      "on before, were not to be found. We accordingly rested on a seat until\n",

      "How altered every thing might be during that time! One sudden and\n",

      "The road ran by the side of the lake, which became narrower as I\n",
      "approached my native town. I discovered more distinctly the black\n",

      "child. “Dear mountains! my own beautiful lake! how do you welcome your\n",

      "Yet, as I drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me. Night also\n",
      "closed around; and when I could hardly see the dark mountains, I felt still\n",
      "more gloomily. The picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil, and I\n",
      "foresaw obscurely that I was destined to become the most wretched of human\n",
      "beings. Alas! I prophesied truly, and failed only in one single\n",

      "It was completely dark when I arrived in the environs of Geneva; the gates\n",

      "progress. It advanced; the heavens were clouded, and I soon felt the rain\n",
      "coming slowly in large drops, but its violence quickly increased.\n",
      "\n",
      "I quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm\n",
      "increased every minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash\n",
      "over my head. It was echoed from Salêve, the Juras, and the Alps of\n",
      "Savoy; vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the\n",
      "lake, making it appear like a vast sheet of fire; then for an instant\n",
      "every thing seemed of a pitchy darkness, until the eye recovered itself\n",
      "from the preceding flash. The storm, as is often the case in\n",
      "Switzerland, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens. The\n",
      "most violent storm hung exactly north of the town, over the part of the\n",
      "lake which lies between the promontory of Belrive and the village of\n",
      "Copêt. Another storm enlightened Jura with faint flashes; and another\n",
      "darkened and sometimes disclosed the Môle, a peaked mountain to the\n",
      "east of the lake.\n",
      "\n",
      "While I watched the tempest, so beautiful yet terrific, I wandered on with\n",
      "a hasty step. This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I clasped my\n",
      "hands, and exclaimed aloud, “William, dear angel! this is thy\n",
      "funeral, this thy dirge!” As I said these words, I perceived in the\n",
      "gloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me; I stood\n",
      "fixed, gazing intently: I could not be mistaken. A flash of lightning\n",
      "illuminated the object, and discovered its shape plainly to me; its\n",
      "gigantic stature, and the deformity of its aspect more hideous than belongs\n",
      "to humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy\n",
      "dæmon, to whom I had given life. What did he there? Could he be (I\n",
      "shuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother? No sooner did that\n",
      "idea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of its truth; my teeth\n",
      "chattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree for support. The figure\n",
      "passed me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom. Nothing in human shape could\n",
      "have destroyed the fair child. _He_ was the murderer! I could not\n",
      "doubt it. The mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the\n",
      "fact. I thought of pursuing the devil; but it would have been in vain, for\n",
      "another flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly\n",
      "perpendicular ascent of Mont Salêve, a hill that bounds Plainpalais on the\n",
      "south. He soon reached the summit, and disappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "I remained motionless. The thunder ceased; but the rain still\n",
      "continued, and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness. I\n",
      "revolved in my mind the events which I had until now sought to forget:\n",
      "the whole train of my progress toward the creation; the appearance of\n",
      "the works of my own hands at my bedside; its departure. Two years had\n",
      "now nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life; and\n",
      "was this his first crime? Alas! I had turned loose into the world a\n",
      "depraved wretch, whose delight was in carnage and misery; had he not\n",
      "murdered my brother?\n",
      "\n",
      "No one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the\n",
      "night, which I spent, cold and wet, in the open air. But I did not\n",
      "feel the inconvenience of the weather; my imagination was busy in\n",
      "scenes of evil and despair. I considered the being whom I had cast\n",
      "among mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes\n",
      "of horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light\n",
      "of my own vampire, my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced\n",
      "to destroy all that was dear to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Day dawned; and I directed my steps towards the town. The gates were\n",
      "open, and I hastened to my father’s house. My first thought was to\n",
      "discover what I knew of the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be\n",
      "made. But I paused when I reflected on the story that I had to tell. A\n",
      "being whom I myself had formed, and endued with life, had met me at\n",
      "midnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain. I\n",
      "remembered also the nervous fever with which I had been seized just at\n",
      "the time that I dated my creation, and which would give an air of\n",
      "delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable. I well knew that\n",
      "if any other had communicated such a relation to me, I should have\n",
      "looked upon it as the ravings of insanity. Besides, the strange nature\n",
      "of the animal would elude all pursuit, even if I were so far credited\n",
      "as to persuade my relatives to commence it. And then of what use would\n",
      "be pursuit? Who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the\n",
      "overhanging sides of Mont Salêve? These reflections determined me, and\n",
      "I resolved to remain silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was about five in the morning when I entered my father’s house. I\n",
      "told the servants not to disturb the family, and went into the library\n",
      "to attend their usual hour of rising.\n",
      "\n",
      "Six years had elapsed, passed in a dream but for one indelible trace, and I\n",
      "stood in the same place where I had last embraced my father before my\n",
      "departure for Ingolstadt. Beloved and venerable parent! He still remained\n",
      "to me. I gazed on the picture of my mother, which stood over the\n",
      "mantel-piece. It was an historical subject, painted at my father’s\n",
      "desire, and represented Caroline Beaufort in an agony of despair, kneeling\n",
      "by the coffin of her dead father. Her garb was rustic, and her cheek pale;\n",
      "but there was an air of dignity and beauty, that hardly permitted the\n",
      "sentiment of pity. Below this picture was a miniature of William; and my\n",
      "tears flowed when I looked upon it. While I was thus engaged, Ernest\n",
      "entered: he had heard me arrive, and hastened to welcome me:\n",
      "“Welcome, my dearest Victor,” said he. “Ah! I wish you\n",
      "had come three months ago, and then you would have found us all joyous and\n",
      "delighted. You come to us now to share a misery which nothing can\n",
      "alleviate; yet your presence will, I hope, revive our father, who seems\n",
      "sinking under his misfortune; and your persuasions will induce poor\n",
      "Elizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting self-accusations.—Poor\n",
      "William! he was our darling and our pride!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Tears, unrestrained, fell from my brother’s eyes; a sense of mortal\n",
      "agony crept over my frame. Before, I had only imagined the\n",
      "wretchedness of my desolated home; the reality came on me as a new, and\n",
      "a not less terrible, disaster. I tried to calm Ernest; I enquired more\n",
      "minutely concerning my father, and here I named my cousin.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She most of all,” said Ernest, “requires consolation; she accused\n",
      "herself of having caused the death of my brother, and that made her\n",
      "very wretched. But since the murderer has been discovered—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The murderer discovered! Good God! how can that be? who could attempt\n",
      "to pursue him? It is impossible; one might as well try to overtake the\n",
      "winds, or confine a mountain-stream with a straw. I saw him too; he\n",
      "was free last night!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not know what you mean,” replied my brother, in accents of\n",
      "wonder, “but to us the discovery we have made completes our misery. No\n",
      "one would believe it at first; and even now Elizabeth will not be\n",
      "convinced, notwithstanding all the evidence. Indeed, who would credit\n",
      "that Justine Moritz, who was so amiable, and fond of all the family,\n",
      "could suddenly become so capable of so frightful, so appalling a crime?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Justine Moritz! Poor, poor girl, is she the accused? But it is\n",
      "wrongfully; every one knows that; no one believes it, surely, Ernest?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No one did at first; but several circumstances came out, that have\n",
      "almost forced conviction upon us; and her own behaviour has been so\n",
      "confused, as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that, I fear,\n",
      "leaves no hope for doubt. But she will be tried today, and you will\n",
      "then hear all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He then related that, the morning on which the murder of poor William\n",
      "had been discovered, Justine had been taken ill, and confined to her\n",
      "bed for several days. During this interval, one of the servants,\n",
      "happening to examine the apparel she had worn on the night of the\n",
      "murder, had discovered in her pocket the picture of my mother, which\n",
      "had been judged to be the temptation of the murderer. The servant\n",
      "instantly showed it to one of the others, who, without saying a word to\n",
      "any of the family, went to a magistrate; and, upon their deposition,\n",
      "Justine was apprehended. On being charged with the fact, the poor girl\n",
      "confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of\n",
      "manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and I replied\n",
      "earnestly, “You are all mistaken; I know the murderer. Justine, poor,\n",
      "good Justine, is innocent.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At that instant my father entered. I saw unhappiness deeply impressed\n",
      "on his countenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully; and,\n",
      "after we had exchanged our mournful greeting, would have introduced\n",
      "some other topic than that of our disaster, had not Ernest exclaimed,\n",
      "“Good God, papa! Victor says that he knows who was the murderer of\n",
      "poor William.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We do also, unfortunately,” replied my father, “for indeed I had\n",
      "rather have been for ever ignorant than have discovered so much\n",
      "depravity and ungratitude in one I valued so highly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is innocent.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty. She is to be\n",
      "tried today, and I hope, I sincerely hope, that she will be acquitted.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This speech calmed me. I was firmly convinced in my own mind that\n",
      "Justine, and indeed every human being, was guiltless of this murder. I\n",
      "had no fear, therefore, that any circumstantial evidence could be\n",
      "brought forward strong enough to convict her. My tale was not one to\n",
      "announce publicly; its astounding horror would be looked upon as\n",
      "madness by the vulgar. Did any one indeed exist, except I, the\n",
      "creator, who would believe, unless his senses convinced him, in the\n",
      "existence of the living monument of presumption and rash ignorance\n",
      "which I had let loose upon the world?\n",
      "\n",
      "We were soon joined by Elizabeth. Time had altered her since I last\n",
      "beheld her; it had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty of\n",
      "her childish years. There was the same candour, the same vivacity, but\n",
      "it was allied to an expression more full of sensibility and intellect.\n",
      "She welcomed me with the greatest affection. “Your arrival, my dear\n",
      "cousin,” said she, “fills me with hope. You perhaps will find some\n",
      "means to justify my poor guiltless Justine. Alas! who is safe, if she\n",
      "be convicted of crime? I rely on her innocence as certainly as I do\n",
      "upon my own. Our misfortune is doubly hard to us; we have not only\n",
      "lost that lovely darling boy, but this poor girl, whom I sincerely\n",
      "love, is to be torn away by even a worse fate. If she is condemned, I\n",
      "never shall know joy more. But she will not, I am sure she will not;\n",
      "and then I shall be happy again, even after the sad death of my little\n",
      "William.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She is innocent, my Elizabeth,” said I, “and that shall\n",
      "be proved; fear nothing, but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance\n",
      "of her acquittal.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How kind and generous you are! every one else believes in her guilt,\n",
      "and that made me wretched, for I knew that it was impossible: and to\n",
      "see every one else prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me\n",
      "hopeless and despairing.” She wept.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dearest niece,” said my father, “dry your tears. If she\n",
      "is, as you believe, innocent, rely on the justice of our laws, and the\n",
      "activity with which I shall prevent the slightest shadow of\n",
      "partiality.”\n",

      "We passed a few sad hours until eleven o’clock, when the trial was to\n",
      "commence. My father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend\n",
      "as witnesses, I accompanied them to the court. During the whole of\n",
      "this wretched mockery of justice I suffered living torture. It was to\n",
      "be decided whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would\n",
      "cause the death of two of my fellow beings: one a smiling babe full of\n",
      "innocence and joy, the other far more dreadfully murdered, with every\n",
      "aggravation of infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror.\n",
      "Justine also was a girl of merit and possessed qualities which promised\n",
      "to render her life happy; now all was to be obliterated in an\n",
      "ignominious grave, and I the cause! A thousand times rather would I\n",
      "have confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to Justine, but I\n",
      "was absent when it was committed, and such a declaration would have\n",
      "been considered as the ravings of a madman and would not have\n",
      "exculpated her who suffered through me.\n",
      "\n",
      "The appearance of Justine was calm. She was dressed in mourning, and\n",
      "her countenance, always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of her\n",
      "feelings, exquisitely beautiful. Yet she appeared confident in\n",
      "innocence and did not tremble, although gazed on and execrated by\n",
      "thousands, for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have\n",
      "excited was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the\n",
      "imagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed. She\n",
      "was tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as\n",
      "her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she\n",
      "worked up her mind to an appearance of courage. When she entered the\n",
      "court she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were\n",
      "seated. A tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us, but she quickly\n",
      "recovered herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest\n",
      "her utter guiltlessness.\n",
      "\n",
      "The trial began, and after the advocate against her had stated the\n",
      "charge, several witnesses were called. Several strange facts combined\n",
      "against her, which might have staggered anyone who had not such proof\n",
      "of her innocence as I had. She had been out the whole of the night on\n",
      "which the murder had been committed and towards morning had been\n",
      "perceived by a market-woman not far from the spot where the body of the\n",
      "murdered child had been afterwards found. The woman asked her what she\n",
      "did there, but she looked very strangely and only returned a confused\n",
      "and unintelligible answer. She returned to the house about eight\n",
      "o’clock, and when one inquired where she had passed the night, she\n",
      "replied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestly\n",
      "if anything had been heard concerning him. When shown the body, she\n",
      "fell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days. The\n",
      "picture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket;\n",
      "and when Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it was the same\n",
      "which, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed round\n",
      "his neck, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court.\n",
      "\n",
      "Justine was called on for her defence. As the trial had proceeded, her\n",
      "countenance had altered. Surprise, horror, and misery were strongly\n",
      "expressed. Sometimes she struggled with her tears, but when she was\n",
      "desired to plead, she collected her powers and spoke in an audible\n",
      "although variable voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“God knows,” she said, “how entirely I am innocent. But I\n",
      "do not pretend that my protestations should acquit me; I rest my innocence\n",
      "on a plain and simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced\n",
      "against me, and I hope the character I have always borne will incline my\n",
      "judges to a favourable interpretation where any circumstance appears\n",
      "doubtful or suspicious.”\n",

      "She then related that, by the permission of Elizabeth, she had passed\n",
      "the evening of the night on which the murder had been committed at the\n",
      "house of an aunt at Chêne, a village situated at about a league from\n",
      "Geneva. On her return, at about nine o’clock, she met a man who asked\n",
      "her if she had seen anything of the child who was lost. She was\n",
      "alarmed by this account and passed several hours in looking for him,\n",
      "when the gates of Geneva were shut, and she was forced to remain\n",
      "several hours of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage, being\n",
      "unwilling to call up the inhabitants, to whom she was well known. Most\n",
      "of the night she spent here watching; towards morning she believed that\n",
      "she slept for a few minutes; some steps disturbed her, and she awoke.\n",
      "It was dawn, and she quitted her asylum, that she might again endeavour\n",
      "to find my brother. If she had gone near the spot where his body lay,\n",
      "it was without her knowledge. That she had been bewildered when\n",
      "questioned by the market-woman was not surprising, since she had passed\n",
      "a sleepless night and the fate of poor William was yet uncertain.\n",
      "Concerning the picture she could give no account.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know,” continued the unhappy victim, “how heavily and\n",
      "fatally this one circumstance weighs against me, but I have no power of\n",
      "explaining it; and when I have expressed my utter ignorance, I am only left\n",
      "to conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have been\n",
      "placed in my pocket. But here also I am checked. I believe that I have no\n",
      "enemy on earth, and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy me\n",
      "wantonly. Did the murderer place it there? I know of no opportunity\n",
      "afforded him for so doing; or, if I had, why should he have stolen the\n",
      "jewel, to part with it again so soon?\n",
      "\n",
      "“I commit my cause to the justice of my judges, yet I see no room for\n",

      "guilt, I must be condemned, although I would pledge my salvation on my\n",
      "innocence.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Several witnesses were called who had known her for many years, and\n",
      "they spoke well of her; but fear and hatred of the crime of which they\n",
      "supposed her guilty rendered them timorous and unwilling to come\n",
      "forward. Elizabeth saw even this last resource, her excellent\n",
      "dispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to fail the accused,\n",
      "when, although violently agitated, she desired permission to address\n",
      "the court.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am,” said she, “the cousin of the unhappy child who\n",
      "was murdered, or rather his sister, for I was educated by and have lived\n",
      "with his parents ever since and even long before his birth. It may\n",
      "therefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion, but\n",
      "when I see a fellow creature about to perish through the cowardice of her\n",
      "pretended friends, I wish to be allowed to speak, that I may say what I\n",
      "know of her character. I am well acquainted with the accused. I have lived\n",
      "in the same house with her, at one time for five and at another for nearly\n",
      "two years. During all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and\n",
      "benevolent of human creatures. She nursed Madame Frankenstein, my aunt, in\n",
      "her last illness, with the greatest affection and care and afterwards\n",
      "attended her own mother during a tedious illness, in a manner that excited\n",
      "the admiration of all who knew her, after which she again lived in my\n",
      "uncle’s house, where she was beloved by all the family. She was\n",
      "warmly attached to the child who is now dead and acted towards him like a\n",
      "most affectionate mother. For my own part, I do not hesitate to say that,\n",
      "notwithstanding all the evidence produced against her, I believe and rely\n",
      "on her perfect innocence. She had no temptation for such an action; as to\n",
      "the bauble on which the chief proof rests, if she had earnestly desired it,\n",

      "A murmur of approbation followed Elizabeth’s simple and powerful\n",

      "renewed violence, charging her with the blackest ingratitude. She\n",
      "herself wept as Elizabeth spoke, but she did not answer. My own\n",
      "agitation and anguish was extreme during the whole trial. I believed\n",
      "in her innocence; I knew it. Could the dæmon who had (I did not for a\n",
      "minute doubt) murdered my brother also in his hellish sport have\n",
      "betrayed the innocent to death and ignominy? I could not sustain the\n",
      "horror of my situation, and when I perceived that the popular voice and\n",
      "the countenances of the judges had already condemned my unhappy victim,\n",
      "I rushed out of the court in agony. The tortures of the accused did\n",
      "not equal mine; she was sustained by innocence, but the fangs of\n",
      "remorse tore my bosom and would not forgo their hold.\n",

      "consolation. Elizabeth also wept and was unhappy, but hers also was\n",
      "the misery of innocence, which, like a cloud that passes over the fair\n",
      "moon, for a while hides but cannot tarnish its brightness. Anguish and\n",
      "despair had penetrated into the core of my heart; I bore a hell within\n",
      "me which nothing could extinguish. We stayed several hours with\n",

      "heavenly—if I except some bat, or the frogs, whose harsh and\n",

      "a child whom she had nursed from its birth, and appeared to love as if\n",
      "it had been her own! I could not consent to the death of any human\n",

      "deeply; but I am not so wretched as you are. There is an expression of\n",

      "my home, and bending my steps towards the near Alpine valleys, sought\n",
      "in the magnificence, the eternity of such scenes, to forget myself and\n",
      "my ephemeral, because human, sorrows. My wanderings were directed\n",
      "towards the valley of Chamounix. I had visited it frequently during my\n",
      "boyhood. Six years had passed since then: _I_ was a wreck, but nought\n",
      "had changed in those savage and enduring scenes.\n",
      "\n",
      "I performed the first part of my journey on horseback. I afterwards\n",
      "hired a mule, as the more sure-footed and least liable to receive\n",
      "injury on these rugged roads. The weather was fine; it was about the\n",
      "middle of the month of August, nearly two months after the death of\n",
      "Justine, that miserable epoch from which I dated all my woe. The\n",
      "weight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as I plunged yet deeper in\n",
      "the ravine of Arve. The immense mountains and precipices that overhung\n",
      "me on every side, the sound of the river raging among the rocks, and\n",
      "the dashing of the waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty as\n",
      "Omnipotence—and I ceased to fear or to bend before any being less\n",
      "almighty than that which had created and ruled the elements, here\n",
      "displayed in their most terrific guise. Still, as I ascended higher,\n",
      "the valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character.\n",
      "Ruined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains, the\n",
      "impetuous Arve, and cottages every here and there peeping forth from\n",
      "among the trees formed a scene of singular beauty. But it was\n",
      "augmented and rendered sublime by the mighty Alps, whose white and\n",
      "shining pyramids and domes towered above all, as belonging to another\n",
      "earth, the habitations of another race of beings.\n",
      "\n",
      "I passed the bridge of Pélissier, where the ravine, which the river\n",
      "forms, opened before me, and I began to ascend the mountain that\n",
      "overhangs it. Soon after, I entered the valley of Chamounix. This\n",
      "valley is more wonderful and sublime, but not so beautiful and\n",
      "picturesque as that of Servox, through which I had just passed. The\n",
      "high and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries, but I saw no\n",
      "more ruined castles and fertile fields. Immense glaciers approached\n",
      "the road; I heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche and\n",
      "marked the smoke of its passage. Mont Blanc, the supreme and\n",
      "magnificent Mont Blanc, raised itself from the surrounding _aiguilles_,\n",
      "and its tremendous _dôme_ overlooked the valley.\n",
      "\n",
      "A tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me during this\n",
      "journey. Some turn in the road, some new object suddenly perceived and\n",
      "recognised, reminded me of days gone by, and were associated with the\n",
      "lighthearted gaiety of boyhood. The very winds whispered in soothing\n",
      "accents, and maternal Nature bade me weep no more. Then again the\n",
      "kindly influence ceased to act—I found myself fettered again to grief\n",
      "and indulging in all the misery of reflection. Then I spurred on my\n",
      "animal, striving so to forget the world, my fears, and more than all,\n",
      "myself—or, in a more desperate fashion, I alighted and threw myself on\n",

      "scattered around; and the solemn silence of this glorious\n",
      "presence-chamber of imperial Nature was broken only by the brawling\n",
      "waves or the fall of some vast fragment, the thunder sound of the\n",
      "avalanche or the cracking, reverberated along the mountains, of the\n",
      "accumulated ice, which, through the silent working of immutable laws,\n",
      "was ever and anon rent and torn, as if it had been but a plaything in\n",
      "their hands. These sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the\n",
      "greatest consolation that I was capable of receiving. They elevated me\n",

      "waited on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which I\n",
      "had contemplated during the day. They congregated round me; the\n",
      "unstained snowy mountain-top, the glittering pinnacle, the pine woods,\n",

      "in their cloudy retreats. What were rain and storm to me? My mule was\n",
      "brought to the door, and I resolved to ascend to the summit of\n",

      "and ever-moving glacier had produced upon my mind when I first saw it.\n",
      "It had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the\n",

      "the traces of the winter avalanche may be perceived, where trees lie\n",

      "leaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain or transversely upon\n",

      "uneven, rising like the waves of a troubled sea, descending low, and\n",
      "interspersed by rifts that sink deep. The field of ice is almost a\n",

      "“It was about seven in the morning, and I longed to obtain food and\n",
      "shelter; at length I perceived a small hut, on a rising ground, which\n",
      "had doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd. This\n",
      "was a new sight to me, and I examined the structure with great\n",
      "curiosity. Finding the door open, I entered. An old man sat in it,\n",
      "near a fire, over which he was preparing his breakfast. He turned on\n",
      "hearing a noise, and perceiving me, shrieked loudly, and quitting the\n",
      "hut, ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form\n",
      "hardly appeared capable. His appearance, different from any I had ever\n",
      "before seen, and his flight somewhat surprised me. But I was enchanted\n",
      "by the appearance of the hut; here the snow and rain could not\n",
      "penetrate; the ground was dry; and it presented to me then as exquisite\n",
      "and divine a retreat as Pandæmonium appeared to the dæmons of hell\n",
      "after their sufferings in the lake of fire. I greedily devoured the\n",
      "remnants of the shepherd’s breakfast, which consisted of bread, cheese,\n",
      "milk, and wine; the latter, however, I did not like. Then, overcome by\n",
      "fatigue, I lay down among some straw and fell asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was noon when I awoke, and allured by the warmth of the sun, which\n",
      "shone brightly on the white ground, I determined to recommence my\n",
      "travels; and, depositing the remains of the peasant’s breakfast in a\n",
      "wallet I found, I proceeded across the fields for several hours, until\n",
      "at sunset I arrived at a village. How miraculous did this appear! The\n",
      "huts, the neater cottages, and stately houses engaged my admiration by\n",
      "turns. The vegetables in the gardens, the milk and cheese that I saw\n",
      "placed at the windows of some of the cottages, allured my appetite. One\n",
      "of the best of these I entered, but I had hardly placed my foot within\n",
      "the door before the children shrieked, and one of the women fainted.\n",
      "The whole village was roused; some fled, some attacked me, until,\n",
      "grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons, I\n",
      "escaped to the open country and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel,\n",
      "quite bare, and making a wretched appearance after the palaces I had\n",
      "beheld in the village. This hovel however, joined a cottage of a neat\n",
      "and pleasant appearance, but after my late dearly bought experience, I\n",
      "dared not enter it. My place of refuge was constructed of wood, but so\n",
      "low that I could with difficulty sit upright in it. No wood, however,\n",
      "was placed on the earth, which formed the floor, but it was dry; and\n",
      "although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks, I found it an\n",
      "agreeable asylum from the snow and rain.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here, then, I retreated and lay down happy to have found a shelter,\n",
      "however miserable, from the inclemency of the season, and still more\n",
      "from the barbarity of man. As soon as morning dawned I crept from my\n",
      "kennel, that I might view the adjacent cottage and discover if I could\n",
      "remain in the habitation I had found. It was situated against the back\n",
      "of the cottage and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig\n",
      "sty and a clear pool of water. One part was open, and by that I had\n",
      "crept in; but now I covered every crevice by which I might be perceived\n",
      "with stones and wood, yet in such a manner that I might move them on\n",
      "occasion to pass out; all the light I enjoyed came through the sty, and\n",
      "that was sufficient for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw, I\n",
      "retired, for I saw the figure of a man at a distance, and I remembered\n",
      "too well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power. I\n",
      "had first, however, provided for my sustenance for that day by a loaf\n",
      "of coarse bread, which I purloined, and a cup with which I could drink\n",
      "more conveniently than from my hand of the pure water which flowed by\n",
      "my retreat. The floor was a little raised, so that it was kept\n",
      "perfectly dry, and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was\n",
      "tolerably warm.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Being thus provided, I resolved to reside in this hovel until\n",
      "something should occur which might alter my determination. It was\n",
      "indeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest, my former residence,\n",
      "the rain-dropping branches, and dank earth. I ate my breakfast with\n",
      "pleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little\n",
      "water when I heard a step, and looking through a small chink, I beheld\n",
      "a young creature, with a pail on her head, passing before my hovel. The\n",
      "girl was young and of gentle demeanour, unlike what I have since found\n",
      "cottagers and farmhouse servants to be. Yet she was meanly dressed, a\n",
      "coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb; her fair\n",
      "hair was plaited but not adorned: she looked patient yet sad. I lost\n",
      "sight of her, and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing\n",
      "the pail, which was now partly filled with milk. As she walked along,\n",
      "seemingly incommoded by the burden, a young man met her, whose\n",
      "countenance expressed a deeper despondence. Uttering a few sounds with\n",
      "an air of melancholy, he took the pail from her head and bore it to the\n",
      "cottage himself. She followed, and they disappeared. Presently I saw\n",
      "the young man again, with some tools in his hand, cross the field\n",
      "behind the cottage; and the girl was also busied, sometimes in the\n",
      "house and sometimes in the yard.\n",
      "\n",
      "“On examining my dwelling, I found that one of the windows of the\n",
      "cottage had formerly occupied a part of it, but the panes had been\n",
      "filled up with wood. In one of these was a small and almost\n",
      "imperceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate.\n",
      "Through this crevice a small room was visible, whitewashed and clean\n",
      "but very bare of furniture. In one corner, near a small fire, sat an\n",
      "old man, leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude. The\n",
      "young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage; but presently she\n",
      "took something out of a drawer, which employed her hands, and she sat\n",
      "down beside the old man, who, taking up an instrument, began to play\n",
      "and to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the\n",
      "nightingale. It was a lovely sight, even to me, poor wretch who had\n",
      "never beheld aught beautiful before. The silver hair and benevolent\n",
      "countenance of the aged cottager won my reverence, while the gentle\n",
      "manners of the girl enticed my love. He played a sweet mournful air\n",
      "which I perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion, of\n",
      "which the old man took no notice, until she sobbed audibly; he then\n",
      "pronounced a few sounds, and the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt\n",
      "at his feet. He raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection\n",
      "that I felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature; they were\n",
      "a mixture of pain and pleasure, such as I had never before experienced,\n",
      "either from hunger or cold, warmth or food; and I withdrew from the\n",
      "window, unable to bear these emotions.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Soon after this the young man returned, bearing on his shoulders a\n",
      "load of wood. The girl met him at the door, helped to relieve him of\n",
      "his burden, and taking some of the fuel into the cottage, placed it on\n",
      "the fire; then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage,\n",
      "and he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese. She seemed\n",
      "pleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants, which she\n",
      "placed in water, and then upon the fire. She afterwards continued her\n",
      "work, whilst the young man went into the garden and appeared busily\n",
      "employed in digging and pulling up roots. After he had been employed\n",
      "thus about an hour, the young woman joined him and they entered the\n",
      "cottage together.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The old man had, in the meantime, been pensive, but on the appearance\n",
      "of his companions he assumed a more cheerful air, and they sat down to\n",
      "eat. The meal was quickly dispatched. The young woman was again\n",
      "occupied in arranging the cottage, the old man walked before the\n",
      "cottage in the sun for a few minutes, leaning on the arm of the youth.\n",
      "Nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent\n",
      "creatures. One was old, with silver hairs and a countenance beaming\n",
      "with benevolence and love; the younger was slight and graceful in his\n",
      "figure, and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry, yet his\n",
      "eyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency. The\n",
      "old man returned to the cottage, and the youth, with tools different\n",
      "from those he had used in the morning, directed his steps across the\n",
      "fields.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Night quickly shut in, but to my extreme wonder, I found that the\n",
      "cottagers had a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers, and was\n",
      "delighted to find that the setting of the sun did not put an end to the\n",
      "pleasure I experienced in watching my human neighbours. In the evening\n",
      "the young girl and her companion were employed in various occupations\n",
      "which I did not understand; and the old man again took up the\n",
      "instrument which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in\n",
      "the morning. So soon as he had finished, the youth began, not to play,\n",
      "but to utter sounds that were monotonous, and neither resembling the\n",
      "harmony of the old man’s instrument nor the songs of the birds; I since\n",
      "found that he read aloud, but at that time I knew nothing of the\n",
      "science of words or letters.\n",

      "occurrences of the day. What chiefly struck me was the gentle manners\n",
      "of these people, and I longed to join them, but dared not. I\n",
      "remembered too well the treatment I had suffered the night before from\n",

      "“This day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it.\n",

      "“They were not entirely happy. The young man and his companion often\n",
      "went apart and appeared to weep. I saw no cause for their unhappiness,\n",
      "but I was deeply affected by it. If such lovely creatures were\n",
      "miserable, it was less strange that I, an imperfect and solitary being,\n",
      "should be wretched. Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy? They\n",
      "possessed a delightful house (for such it was in my eyes) and every\n",
      "luxury; they had a fire to warm them when chill and delicious viands\n",
      "when hungry; they were dressed in excellent clothes; and, still more,\n",
      "they enjoyed one another’s company and speech, interchanging each day\n",
      "looks of affection and kindness. What did their tears imply? Did they\n",
      "really express pain? I was at first unable to solve these questions,\n",
      "but perpetual attention and time explained to me many appearances which\n",
      "were at first enigmatic.\n",

      "“A considerable period elapsed before I discovered one of the causes of\n",
      "the uneasiness of this amiable family: it was poverty, and they\n",
      "suffered that evil in a very distressing degree. Their nourishment\n",
      "consisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden and the milk of\n",
      "one cow, which gave very little during the winter, when its masters\n",
      "could scarcely procure food to support it. They often, I believe,\n",

      "man when they reserved none for themselves.\n",
      "\n",

      "during the night, to steal a part of their store for my own\n",

      "the cottagers, I abstained and satisfied myself with berries, nuts, and\n",
      "roots which I gathered from a neighbouring wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I discovered also another means through which I was enabled to assist\n",
      "their labours. I found that the youth spent a great part of each day\n",
      "in collecting wood for the family fire, and during the night I often\n",
      "took his tools, the use of which I quickly discovered, and brought home\n",
      "firing sufficient for the consumption of several days.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I remember, the first time that I did this, the young woman, when she\n",
      "opened the door in the morning, appeared greatly astonished on seeing a great\n",
      "pile of wood on the outside. She uttered some words in a loud voice, and the\n",
      "youth joined her, who also expressed surprise. I observed, with pleasure,\n",
      "that he did not go to the forest that day, but spent it in repairing the\n",

      "feelings to one another by articulate sounds. I perceived that the words\n",
      "they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness, in the\n",
      "minds and countenances of the hearers. This was indeed a godlike science,\n",
      "and I ardently desired to become acquainted with it. But I was baffled in\n",
      "every attempt I made for this purpose. Their pronunciation was quick, and\n",
      "the words they uttered, not having any apparent connection with visible\n",
      "objects, I was unable to discover any clue by which I could unravel the\n",
      "mystery of their reference. By great application, however, and after having\n",
      "remained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel, I\n",
      "discovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of\n",
      "discourse; I learned and applied the words, _fire, milk, bread,_ and\n",
      "_wood._ I learned also the names of the cottagers themselves. The youth\n",
      "and his companion had each of them several names, but the old man had only\n",
      "one, which was _father._ The girl was called _sister_ or\n",
      "_Agatha,_ and the youth _Felix, brother,_ or _son_. I cannot\n",
      "describe the delight I felt when I learned the ideas appropriated to each of\n",
      "these sounds and was able to pronounce them. I distinguished several other\n",
      "words without being able as yet to understand or apply them, such as _good,\n",
      "dearest, unhappy._\n",
      "\n",
      "“I spent the winter in this manner. The gentle manners and beauty of\n",
      "the cottagers greatly endeared them to me; when they were unhappy, I\n",
      "felt depressed; when they rejoiced, I sympathised in their joys. I saw\n",
      "few human beings besides them, and if any other happened to enter the\n",
      "cottage, their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the\n",
      "superior accomplishments of my friends. The old man, I could perceive,\n",
      "often endeavoured to encourage his children, as sometimes I found that\n",
      "he called them, to cast off their melancholy. He would talk in a\n",
      "cheerful accent, with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure\n",
      "even upon me. Agatha listened with respect, her eyes sometimes filled\n",
      "with tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived; but I\n",
      "generally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after\n",
      "having listened to the exhortations of her father. It was not thus\n",
      "with Felix. He was always the saddest of the group, and even to my\n",
      "unpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his\n",
      "friends. But if his countenance was more sorrowful, his voice was more\n",
      "cheerful than that of his sister, especially when he addressed the old\n",
      "man.\n",

      "white flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground. Early in\n",
      "the morning, before she had risen, he cleared away the snow that\n",
      "obstructed her path to the milk-house, drew water from the well, and\n",
      "brought the wood from the outhouse, where, to his perpetual\n",
      "astonishment, he found his store always replenished by an invisible\n",
      "hand. In the day, I believe, he worked sometimes for a neighbouring\n",
      "farmer, because he often went forth and did not return until dinner,\n",
      "yet brought no wood with him. At other times he worked in the garden,\n",
      "but as there was little to do in the frosty season, he read to the old\n",
      "man and Agatha.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This reading had puzzled me extremely at first, but by degrees I\n",
      "discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when\n",
      "he talked. I conjectured, therefore, that he found on the paper signs\n",
      "for speech which he understood, and I ardently longed to comprehend\n",
      "these also; but how was that possible when I did not even understand\n",
      "the sounds for which they stood as signs? I improved, however,\n",
      "sensibly in this science, but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of\n",
      "conversation, although I applied my whole mind to the endeavour, for I\n",
      "easily perceived that, although I eagerly longed to discover myself to\n",

      "in a transparent pool! At first I started back, unable to believe that\n",
      "it was indeed I who was reflected in the mirror; and when I became\n",
      "fully convinced that I was in reality the monster that I am, I was\n",
      "filled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification.\n",
      "Alas! I did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable\n",
      "deformity.\n",

      "vanished, and I beheld the bare trees and the black earth. From this\n",
      "time Felix was more employed, and the heart-moving indications of\n",
      "impending famine disappeared. Their food, as I afterwards found, was\n",
      "coarse, but it was wholesome; and they procured a sufficiency of it.\n",
      "Several new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden, which they\n",
      "dressed; and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season\n",
      "advanced.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when it did\n",
      "not rain, as I found it was called when the heavens poured forth its\n",
      "waters. This frequently took place, but a high wind quickly dried the\n",
      "earth, and the season became far more pleasant than it had been.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My mode of life in my hovel was uniform. During the morning I\n",
      "attended the motions of the cottagers, and when they were dispersed in\n",
      "various occupations, I slept; the remainder of the day was spent in\n",
      "observing my friends. When they had retired to rest, if there was any\n",
      "moon or the night was star-light, I went into the woods and collected\n",
      "my own food and fuel for the cottage. When I returned, as often as it\n",
      "was necessary, I cleared their path from the snow and performed those\n",
      "offices that I had seen done by Felix. I afterwards found that these\n",
      "labours, performed by an invisible hand, greatly astonished them; and\n",
      "once or twice I heard them, on these occasions, utter the words _good\n",

      "(foolish wretch!) that it might be in my power to restore happiness to\n",
      "these deserving people. When I slept or was absent, the forms of the\n",

      "thousand pictures of presenting myself to them, and their reception of\n",
      "me. I imagined that they would be disgusted, until, by my gentle\n",

      "tones, yet I pronounced such words as I understood with tolerable ease.\n",
      "It was as the ass and the lap-dog; yet surely the gentle ass whose\n",

      "have made me what I am.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Spring advanced rapidly; the weather became fine and the skies\n",
      "cloudless. It surprised me that what before was desert and gloomy\n",

      "“It was on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically rested\n",
      "from labour—the old man played on his guitar, and the children\n",
      "listened to him—that I observed the countenance of Felix was\n",
      "melancholy beyond expression; he sighed frequently, and once his father\n",
      "paused in his music, and I conjectured by his manner that he inquired\n",
      "the cause of his son’s sorrow. Felix replied in a cheerful accent, and\n",
      "the old man was recommencing his music when someone tapped at the door.\n",

      "“It was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a country-man as a guide.\n",
      "The lady was dressed in a dark suit and covered with a thick black\n",
      "veil. Agatha asked a question, to which the stranger only replied by\n",
      "pronouncing, in a sweet accent, the name of Felix. Her voice was\n",
      "musical but unlike that of either of my friends. On hearing this word,\n",
      "Felix came up hastily to the lady, who, when she saw him, threw up her\n",
      "veil, and I beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression. Her\n",
      "hair of a shining raven black, and curiously braided; her eyes were\n",
      "dark, but gentle, although animated; her features of a regular\n",
      "proportion, and her complexion wondrously fair, each cheek tinged with\n",
      "a lovely pink.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her, every trait of\n",
      "sorrow vanished from his face, and it instantly expressed a degree of\n",
      "ecstatic joy, of which I could hardly have believed it capable; his\n",
      "eyes sparkled, as his cheek flushed with pleasure; and at that moment I\n",
      "thought him as beautiful as the stranger. She appeared affected by\n",
      "different feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes, she held\n",
      "out her hand to Felix, who kissed it rapturously and called her, as\n",
      "well as I could distinguish, his sweet Arabian. She did not appear to\n",
      "understand him, but smiled. He assisted her to dismount, and\n",
      "dismissing her guide, conducted her into the cottage. Some\n",
      "conversation took place between him and his father, and the young\n",
      "stranger knelt at the old man’s feet and would have kissed his hand,\n",
      "but he raised her and embraced her affectionately.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I soon perceived that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds\n",
      "and appeared to have a language of her own, she was neither understood\n",
      "by nor herself understood the cottagers. They made many signs which I\n",
      "did not comprehend, but I saw that her presence diffused gladness\n",
      "through the cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the\n",
      "morning mists. Felix seemed peculiarly happy and with smiles of\n",
      "delight welcomed his Arabian. Agatha, the ever-gentle Agatha, kissed\n",
      "the hands of the lovely stranger, and pointing to her brother, made\n",
      "signs which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she\n",
      "came. Some hours passed thus, while they, by their countenances,\n",
      "expressed joy, the cause of which I did not comprehend. Presently I\n",
      "found, by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger\n",
      "repeated after them, that she was endeavouring to learn their language;\n",
      "and the idea instantly occurred to me that I should make use of the\n",
      "same instructions to the same end. The stranger learned about twenty\n",
      "words at the first lesson; most of them, indeed, were those which I had\n",
      "before understood, but I profited by the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As night came on, Agatha and the Arabian retired early. When they\n",
      "separated Felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said, ‘Good night\n",
      "sweet Safie.’ He sat up much longer, conversing with his father, and\n",
      "by the frequent repetition of her name I conjectured that their lovely\n",
      "guest was the subject of their conversation. I ardently desired to\n",
      "understand them, and bent every faculty towards that purpose, but found\n",
      "it utterly impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The next morning Felix went out to his work, and after the usual\n",
      "occupations of Agatha were finished, the Arabian sat at the feet of the\n",
      "old man, and taking his guitar, played some airs so entrancingly\n",
      "beautiful that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my\n",
      "eyes. She sang, and her voice flowed in a rich cadence, swelling or\n",
      "dying away like a nightingale of the woods.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When she had finished, she gave the guitar to Agatha, who at first\n",
      "declined it. She played a simple air, and her voice accompanied it in\n",
      "sweet accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger. The old\n",
      "man appeared enraptured and said some words which Agatha endeavoured to\n",
      "explain to Safie, and by which he appeared to wish to express that she\n",
      "bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The days now passed as peaceably as before, with the sole alteration\n",
      "that joy had taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends.\n",
      "Safie was always gay and happy; she and I improved rapidly in the\n",

      "“In the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage, and\n",
      "the green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers, sweet to the\n",
      "scent and the eyes, stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods;\n",
      "the sun became warmer, the nights clear and balmy; and my nocturnal\n",
      "rambles were an extreme pleasure to me, although they were considerably\n",
      "shortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun, for I never\n",

      "“My days were spent in close attention, that I might more speedily\n",

      "was spoken.\n",
      "\n",
      "“While I improved in speech, I also learned the science of letters as\n",

      "“The book from which Felix instructed Safie was Volney’s _Ruins\n",
      "of Empires_. I should not have understood the purport of this book had not\n",
      "Felix, in reading it, given very minute explanations. He had chosen this\n",
      "work, he said, because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the\n",
      "Eastern authors. Through this work I obtained a cursory knowledge of history\n",
      "and a view of the several empires at present existing in the world; it gave\n",
      "me an insight into the manners, governments, and religions of the different\n",
      "nations of the earth. I heard of the slothful Asiatics, of the stupendous\n",
      "genius and mental activity of the Grecians, of the wars and wonderful virtue\n",
      "of the early Romans—of their subsequent degenerating—of the\n",
      "decline of that mighty empire, of chivalry, Christianity, and kings. I heard\n",

      "hapless fate of its original inhabitants.\n",

      "“These wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings. Was\n",
      "man, indeed, at once so powerful, so virtuous and magnificent, yet so\n",
      "vicious and base? He appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil\n",
      "principle and at another as all that can be conceived of noble and\n",
      "godlike. To be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour\n",
      "that can befall a sensitive being; to be base and vicious, as many on\n",
      "record have been, appeared the lowest degradation, a condition more\n",
      "abject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm. For a long time I\n",
      "could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow, or\n",
      "even why there were laws and governments; but when I heard details of\n",
      "vice and bloodshed, my wonder ceased and I turned away with disgust and\n",
      "loathing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me.\n",
      "While I listened to the instructions which Felix bestowed upon the\n",
      "Arabian, the strange system of human society was explained to me. I\n",
      "heard of the division of property, of immense wealth and squalid\n",
      "poverty, of rank, descent, and noble blood.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The words induced me to turn towards myself. I learned that the\n",
      "possessions most esteemed by your fellow creatures were high and\n",
      "unsullied descent united with riches. A man might be respected with\n",
      "only one of these advantages, but without either he was considered,\n",
      "except in very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to\n",
      "waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few! And what was I? Of\n",
      "my creation and creator I was absolutely ignorant, but I knew that I\n",
      "possessed no money, no friends, no kind of property. I was, besides,\n",
      "endued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome; I was not even\n",
      "of the same nature as man. I was more agile than they and could\n",
      "subsist upon coarser diet; I bore the extremes of heat and cold with\n",
      "less injury to my frame; my stature far exceeded theirs. When I looked\n",
      "around I saw and heard of none like me. Was I, then, a monster, a blot\n",
      "upon the earth, from which all men fled and whom all men disowned?\n",
      "\n",
      "“I cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted\n",
      "upon me; I tried to dispel them, but sorrow only increased with\n",

      "means to overcome the sensation of pain, and that was death—a state\n",
      "which I feared yet did not understand. I admired virtue and good\n",
      "feelings and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my\n",
      "cottagers, but I was shut out from intercourse with them, except\n",
      "through means which I obtained by stealth, when I was unseen and\n",
      "unknown, and which rather increased than satisfied the desire I had of\n",
      "becoming one among my fellows. The gentle words of Agatha and the\n",
      "animated smiles of the charming Arabian were not for me. The mild\n",

      "older child, how all the life and cares of the mother were wrapped up\n",

      "then was in height and proportion. I had never yet seen a being\n",

      "a large and luxurious city called Paris, surrounded by friends and\n",

      "He was seized and cast into prison the very day that Safie arrived from\n",
      "Constantinople to join him. He was tried and condemned to death. The\n",
      "injustice of his sentence was very flagrant; all Paris was indignant;\n",

      "indignation were uncontrollable when he heard the decision of the\n",

      "looked around for the means. After many fruitless attempts to gain\n",
      "admittance to the prison, he found a strongly grated window in an\n",
      "unguarded part of the building, which lighted the dungeon of the\n",
      "unfortunate Muhammadan, who, loaded with chains, waited in despair the\n",
      "execution of the barbarous sentence. Felix visited the grate at night\n",
      "and made known to the prisoner his intentions in his favour. The Turk,\n",
      "amazed and delighted, endeavoured to kindle the zeal of his deliverer\n",
      "by promises of reward and wealth. Felix rejected his offers with\n",
      "contempt, yet when he saw the lovely Safie, who was allowed to visit\n",
      "her father and who by her gestures expressed her lively gratitude, the\n",

      "man, a servant of her father who understood French. She thanked him in\n",
      "the most ardent terms for his intended services towards her parent, and\n",

      "intellect and an independence of spirit forbidden to the female\n",
      "followers of Muhammad. This lady died, but her lessons were indelibly\n",
      "impressed on the mind of Safie, who sickened at the prospect of again\n",
      "returning to Asia and being immured within the walls of a harem,\n",
      "allowed only to occupy herself with infantile amusements, ill-suited to\n",
      "the temper of her soul, now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble\n",

      "expectation of that event; and in the meantime he enjoyed the society\n",
      "of the Arabian, who exhibited towards him the simplest and tenderest\n",
      "affection. They conversed with one another through the means of an\n",
      "interpreter, and sometimes with the interpretation of looks; and Safie\n",
      "sang to him the divine airs of her native country.\n",

      "“The Turk allowed this intimacy to take place and encouraged the hopes\n",
      "of the youthful lovers, while in his heart he had formed far other\n",
      "plans. He loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to a\n",
      "Christian, but he feared the resentment of Felix if he should appear\n",
      "lukewarm, for he knew that he was still in the power of his deliverer\n",
      "if he should choose to betray him to the Italian state which they\n",
      "inhabited. He revolved a thousand plans by which he should be enabled\n",
      "to prolong the deceit until it might be no longer necessary, and\n",
      "secretly to take his daughter with him when he departed. His plans\n",
      "were facilitated by the news which arrived from Paris.\n",

      "in a noisome dungeon while he enjoyed the free air and the society of\n",

      "with the Turk that if the latter should find a favourable opportunity\n",
      "for escape before Felix could return to Italy, Safie should remain as a\n",
      "boarder at a convent at Leghorn; and then, quitting the lovely Arabian,\n",

      "discovering that his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and ruin,\n",
      "became a traitor to good feeling and honour and had quitted Italy with\n",

      "virtue, he gloried in it; but the ingratitude of the Turk and the loss\n",
      "of his beloved Safie were misfortunes more bitter and irreparable. The\n",
      "arrival of the Arabian now infused new life into his soul.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When the news reached Leghorn that Felix was deprived of his wealth\n",

      "their virtues and to deprecate the vices of mankind.\n",
      "\n",

      "“One night during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood where I\n",
      "collected my own food and brought home firing for my protectors, I found on\n",
      "the ground a leathern portmanteau containing several articles of dress and\n",
      "some books. I eagerly seized the prize and returned with it to my hovel. \n",
      "Fortunately the books were written in the language, the elements of which I\n",
      "had acquired at the cottage; they consisted of _Paradise Lost_, a volume\n",
      "of _Plutarch’s Lives_, and the _Sorrows of Werter_. The\n",
      "possession of these treasures gave me extreme delight; I now continually\n",
      "studied and exercised my mind upon these histories, whilst my friends were\n",
      "employed in their ordinary occupations.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can hardly describe to you the effect of these books. They produced\n",
      "in me an infinity of new images and feelings, that sometimes raised me\n",
      "to ecstasy, but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection. In\n",
      "the _Sorrows of Werter_, besides the interest of its simple and affecting\n",
      "story, so many opinions are canvassed and so many lights thrown upon\n",
      "what had hitherto been to me obscure subjects that I found in it a\n",
      "never-ending source of speculation and astonishment. The gentle and\n",
      "domestic manners it described, combined with lofty sentiments and\n",
      "feelings, which had for their object something out of self, accorded\n",
      "well with my experience among my protectors and with the wants which\n",
      "were for ever alive in my own bosom. But I thought Werter himself a\n",
      "more divine being than I had ever beheld or imagined; his character\n",
      "contained no pretension, but it sank deep. The disquisitions upon\n",
      "death and suicide were calculated to fill me with wonder. I did not\n",
      "pretend to enter into the merits of the case, yet I inclined towards\n",
      "the opinions of the hero, whose extinction I wept, without precisely\n",
      "understanding it.\n",

      "“As I read, however, I applied much personally to my own feelings and\n",
      "condition. I found myself similar yet at the same time strangely\n",
      "unlike to the beings concerning whom I read and to whose conversation I\n",
      "was a listener. I sympathised with and partly understood them, but I\n",
      "was unformed in mind; I was dependent on none and related to none.\n",
      "‘The path of my departure was free,’ and there was none to lament my\n",
      "annihilation. My person was hideous and my stature gigantic. What did\n",
      "this mean? Who was I? What was I? Whence did I come? What was my\n",
      "destination? These questions continually recurred, but I was unable to\n",
      "solve them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The volume of _Plutarch’s Lives_ which I possessed contained the\n",
      "histories of the first founders of the ancient republics. This book\n",
      "had a far different effect upon me from the _Sorrows of Werter_. I\n",
      "learned from Werter’s imaginations despondency and gloom, but Plutarch\n",
      "taught me high thoughts; he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my\n",
      "own reflections, to admire and love the heroes of past ages. Many\n",
      "things I read surpassed my understanding and experience. I had a very\n",
      "confused knowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of country, mighty rivers,\n",
      "and boundless seas. But I was perfectly unacquainted with towns and\n",
      "large assemblages of men. The cottage of my protectors had been the\n",
      "only school in which I had studied human nature, but this book\n",
      "developed new and mightier scenes of action. I read of men concerned\n",
      "in public affairs, governing or massacring their species. I felt the\n",
      "greatest ardour for virtue rise within me, and abhorrence for vice, as\n",
      "far as I understood the signification of those terms, relative as they\n",
      "were, as I applied them, to pleasure and pain alone. Induced by these\n",
      "feelings, I was of course led to admire peaceable lawgivers, Numa,\n",
      "Solon, and Lycurgus, in preference to Romulus and Theseus. The\n",
      "patriarchal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a\n",
      "firm hold on my mind; perhaps, if my first introduction to humanity had\n",
      "been made by a young soldier, burning for glory and slaughter, I should\n",
      "have been imbued with different sensations.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But _Paradise Lost_ excited different and far deeper emotions. I read\n",
      "it, as I had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands, as\n",
      "a true history. It moved every feeling of wonder and awe that the\n",
      "picture of an omnipotent God warring with his creatures was capable of\n",
      "exciting. I often referred the several situations, as their similarity\n",
      "struck me, to my own. Like Adam, I was apparently united by no link to\n",
      "any other being in existence; but his state was far different from mine\n",
      "in every other respect. He had come forth from the hands of God a\n",
      "perfect creature, happy and prosperous, guarded by the especial care of\n",
      "his Creator; he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from\n",
      "beings of a superior nature, but I was wretched, helpless, and alone.\n",
      "Many times I considered Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition, for\n",
      "often, like him, when I viewed the bliss of my protectors, the bitter\n",
      "gall of envy rose within me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings. Soon\n",
      "after my arrival in the hovel I discovered some papers in the pocket of\n",
      "the dress which I had taken from your laboratory. At first I had\n",
      "neglected them, but now that I was able to decipher the characters in\n",
      "which they were written, I began to study them with diligence. It was\n",
      "your journal of the four months that preceded my creation. You\n",
      "minutely described in these papers every step you took in the progress\n",
      "of your work; this history was mingled with accounts of domestic\n",
      "occurrences. You doubtless recollect these papers. Here they are.\n",
      "Everything is related in them which bears reference to my accursed\n",
      "origin; the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstances\n",
      "which produced it is set in view; the minutest description of my odious\n",
      "and loathsome person is given, in language which painted your own\n",
      "horrors and rendered mine indelible. I sickened as I read. ‘Hateful\n",
      "day when I received life!’ I exclaimed in agony. ‘Accursed creator!\n",
      "Why did you form a monster so hideous that even _you_ turned from me in\n",
      "disgust? God, in pity, made man beautiful and alluring, after his own\n",
      "image; but my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from the\n",

      "and encourage him, but I am solitary and abhorred.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“These were the reflections of my hours of despondency and solitude;\n",

      "benevolent dispositions, I persuaded myself that when they should\n",
      "become acquainted with my admiration of their virtues they would\n",
      "compassionate me and overlook my personal deformity. Could they turn\n",
      "from their door one, however monstrous, who solicited their compassion\n",
      "and friendship? I resolved, at least, not to despair, but in every way\n",
      "to fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my fate. I\n",
      "postponed this attempt for some months longer, for the importance\n",
      "attached to its success inspired me with a dread lest I should fail.\n",
      "Besides, I found that my understanding improved so much with every\n",
      "day’s experience that I was unwilling to commence this undertaking\n",
      "until a few more months should have added to my sagacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Several changes, in the meantime, took place in the cottage. The\n",
      "presence of Safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants, and I also\n",
      "found that a greater degree of plenty reigned there. Felix and Agatha\n",
      "spent more time in amusement and conversation, and were assisted in\n",
      "their labours by servants. They did not appear rich, but they were\n",
      "contented and happy; their feelings were serene and peaceful, while\n",
      "mine became every day more tumultuous. Increase of knowledge only\n",
      "discovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast I was. I\n",
      "cherished hope, it is true, but it vanished when I beheld my person\n",
      "reflected in water or my shadow in the moonshine, even as that frail\n",
      "image and that inconstant shade.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I endeavoured to crush these fears and to fortify myself for the trial\n",
      "which in a few months I resolved to undergo; and sometimes I allowed my\n",
      "thoughts, unchecked by reason, to ramble in the fields of Paradise, and\n",
      "dared to fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathising with my\n",
      "feelings and cheering my gloom; their angelic countenances breathed\n",
      "smiles of consolation. But it was all a dream; no Eve soothed my\n",
      "sorrows nor shared my thoughts; I was alone. I remembered Adam’s\n",
      "supplication to his Creator. But where was mine? He had abandoned me,\n",
      "and in the bitterness of my heart I cursed him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Autumn passed thus. I saw, with surprise and grief, the leaves decay\n",
      "and fall, and nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance it\n",
      "had worn when I first beheld the woods and the lovely moon. Yet I did\n",
      "not heed the bleakness of the weather; I was better fitted by my\n",
      "conformation for the endurance of cold than heat. But my chief\n",
      "delights were the sight of the flowers, the birds, and all the gay\n",
      "apparel of summer; when those deserted me, I turned with more attention\n",
      "towards the cottagers. Their happiness was not decreased by the\n",
      "absence of summer. They loved and sympathised with one another; and\n",
      "their joys, depending on each other, were not interrupted by the\n",
      "casualties that took place around them. The more I saw of them, the\n",
      "greater became my desire to claim their protection and kindness; my\n",
      "heart yearned to be known and loved by these amiable creatures; to see\n",
      "their sweet looks directed towards me with affection was the utmost\n",
      "limit of my ambition. I dared not think that they would turn them from\n",
      "me with disdain and horror. The poor that stopped at their door were\n",
      "never driven away. I asked, it is true, for greater treasures than a\n",
      "little food or rest: I required kindness and sympathy; but I did not\n",

      "“The winter advanced, and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken\n",
      "place since I awoke into life. My attention at this time was solely\n",
      "directed towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my\n",
      "protectors. I revolved many projects, but that on which I finally\n",
      "fixed was to enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be alone.\n",
      "I had sagacity enough to discover that the unnatural hideousness of my\n",
      "person was the chief object of horror with those who had formerly\n",
      "beheld me. My voice, although harsh, had nothing terrible in it; I\n",
      "thought, therefore, that if in the absence of his children I could gain\n",

      "and Felix departed on a long country walk, and the old man, at his own\n",
      "desire, was left alone in the cottage. When his children had departed,\n",
      "he took up his guitar and played several mournful but sweet airs, more\n",
      "sweet and mournful than I had ever heard him play before. At first his\n",
      "countenance was illuminated with pleasure, but as he continued,\n",
      "thoughtfulness and sadness succeeded; at length, laying aside the\n",
      "instrument, he sat absorbed in reflection.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My heart beat quick; this was the hour and moment of trial, which\n",
      "would decide my hopes or realise my fears. The servants were gone to a\n",
      "neighbouring fair. All was silent in and around the cottage; it was an\n",
      "excellent opportunity; yet, when I proceeded to execute my plan, my\n",
      "limbs failed me and I sank to the ground. Again I rose, and exerting\n",
      "all the firmness of which I was master, removed the planks which I had\n",
      "placed before my hovel to conceal my retreat. The fresh air revived\n",

      "burst forth amidst the universal stillness. All, save I, were at rest\n",
      "or in enjoyment; I, like the arch-fiend, bore a hell within me, and\n",
      "finding myself unsympathised with, wished to tear up the trees, spread\n",
      "havoc and destruction around me, and then to have sat down and enjoyed\n",
      "the ruin.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure; I became\n",
      "fatigued with excess of bodily exertion and sank on the damp grass in\n",
      "the sick impotence of despair. There was none among the myriads of men\n",
      "that existed who would pity or assist me; and should I feel kindness\n",
      "towards my enemies? No; from that moment I declared everlasting war\n",
      "against the species, and more than all, against him who had formed me\n",
      "and sent me forth to this insupportable misery.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The sun rose; I heard the voices of men and knew that it was\n",
      "impossible to return to my retreat during that day. Accordingly I hid\n",
      "myself in some thick underwood, determining to devote the ensuing hours\n",
      "to reflection on my situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The pleasant sunshine and the pure air of day restored me to some\n",
      "degree of tranquillity; and when I considered what had passed at the\n",
      "cottage, I could not help believing that I had been too hasty in my\n",
      "conclusions. I had certainly acted imprudently. It was apparent that\n",
      "my conversation had interested the father in my behalf, and I was a\n",
      "fool in having exposed my person to the horror of his children. I\n",
      "ought to have familiarised the old De Lacey to me, and by degrees to\n",
      "have discovered myself to the rest of his family, when they should have\n",
      "been prepared for my approach. But I did not believe my errors to be\n",
      "irretrievable, and after much consideration I resolved to return to the\n",
      "cottage, seek the old man, and by my representations win him to my\n",
      "party.\n",
      "\n",
      "“These thoughts calmed me, and in the afternoon I sank into a profound\n",
      "sleep; but the fever of my blood did not allow me to be visited by\n",
      "peaceful dreams. The horrible scene of the preceding day was for ever\n",
      "acting before my eyes; the females were flying and the enraged Felix\n",
      "tearing me from his father’s feet. I awoke exhausted, and finding that\n",
      "it was already night, I crept forth from my hiding-place, and went in\n",
      "search of food.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When my hunger was appeased, I directed my steps towards the\n",
      "well-known path that conducted to the cottage. All there was at peace.\n",
      "I crept into my hovel and remained in silent expectation of the\n",
      "accustomed hour when the family arose. That hour passed, the sun\n",
      "mounted high in the heavens, but the cottagers did not appear. I\n",
      "trembled violently, apprehending some dreadful misfortune. The inside\n",
      "of the cottage was dark, and I heard no motion; I cannot describe the\n",
      "agony of this suspense.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Presently two countrymen passed by, but pausing near the cottage, they\n",
      "entered into conversation, using violent gesticulations; but I did not\n",
      "understand what they said, as they spoke the language of the country,\n",
      "which differed from that of my protectors. Soon after, however, Felix\n",
      "approached with another man; I was surprised, as I knew that he had not\n",
      "quitted the cottage that morning, and waited anxiously to discover from\n",
      "his discourse the meaning of these unusual appearances.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘Do you consider,’ said his companion to him,\n",
      "‘that you will be obliged to pay three months’ rent and to lose\n",
      "the produce of your garden? I do not wish to take any unfair advantage, and\n",
      "I beg therefore that you will take some days to consider of your\n",
      "determination.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘It is utterly useless,’ replied Felix; ‘we can\n",
      "never again inhabit your cottage. The life of my father is in the greatest\n",
      "danger, owing to the dreadful circumstance that I have related. My wife and\n",
      "my sister will never recover from their horror. I entreat you not to reason\n",
      "with me any more. Take possession of your tenement and let me fly from this\n",
      "place.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“Felix trembled violently as he said this. He and his companion\n",
      "entered the cottage, in which they remained for a few minutes, and then\n",
      "departed. I never saw any of the family of De Lacey more.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of\n",
      "utter and stupid despair. My protectors had departed and had broken\n",
      "the only link that held me to the world. For the first time the\n",
      "feelings of revenge and hatred filled my bosom, and I did not strive to\n",
      "control them, but allowing myself to be borne away by the stream, I\n",
      "bent my mind towards injury and death. When I thought of my friends,\n",
      "of the mild voice of De Lacey, the gentle eyes of Agatha, and the\n",
      "exquisite beauty of the Arabian, these thoughts vanished and a gush of\n",
      "tears somewhat soothed me. But again when I reflected that they had\n",
      "spurned and deserted me, anger returned, a rage of anger, and unable to\n",
      "injure anything human, I turned my fury towards inanimate objects. As\n",
      "night advanced, I placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage,\n",
      "and after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden,\n",
      "I waited with forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my\n",
      "operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As the night advanced, a fierce wind arose from the woods and quickly\n",
      "dispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens; the blast tore\n",
      "along like a mighty avalanche and produced a kind of insanity in my\n",
      "spirits that burst all bounds of reason and reflection. I lighted the\n",
      "dry branch of a tree and danced with fury around the devoted cottage,\n",
      "my eyes still fixed on the western horizon, the edge of which the moon\n",
      "nearly touched. A part of its orb was at length hid, and I waved my\n",
      "brand; it sank, and with a loud scream I fired the straw, and heath,\n",
      "and bushes, which I had collected. The wind fanned the fire, and the\n",
      "cottage was quickly enveloped by the flames, which clung to it and\n",
      "licked it with their forked and destroying tongues.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As soon as I was convinced that no assistance could save any part of\n",
      "the habitation, I quitted the scene and sought for refuge in the woods.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And now, with the world before me, whither should I bend my steps? I\n",
      "resolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes; but to me, hated\n",
      "and despised, every country must be equally horrible. At length the\n",
      "thought of you crossed my mind. I learned from your papers that you\n",
      "were my father, my creator; and to whom could I apply with more fitness\n",
      "than to him who had given me life? Among the lessons that Felix had\n",
      "bestowed upon Safie, geography had not been omitted; I had learned from\n",
      "these the relative situations of the different countries of the earth.\n",
      "You had mentioned Geneva as the name of your native town, and towards\n",
      "this place I resolved to proceed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But how was I to direct myself? I knew that I must travel in a\n",
      "southwesterly direction to reach my destination, but the sun was my\n",
      "only guide. I did not know the names of the towns that I was to pass\n",
      "through, nor could I ask information from a single human being; but I\n",
      "did not despair. From you only could I hope for succour, although\n",
      "towards you I felt no sentiment but that of hatred. Unfeeling,\n",
      "heartless creator! You had endowed me with perceptions and passions\n",
      "and then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind.\n",
      "But on you only had I any claim for pity and redress, and from you I\n",
      "determined to seek that justice which I vainly attempted to gain from\n",
      "any other being that wore the human form.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My travels were long and the sufferings I endured intense. It was\n",
      "late in autumn when I quitted the district where I had so long resided.\n",
      "I travelled only at night, fearful of encountering the visage of a\n",
      "human being. Nature decayed around me, and the sun became heatless;\n",
      "rain and snow poured around me; mighty rivers were frozen; the surface\n",
      "of the earth was hard and chill, and bare, and I found no shelter. Oh,\n",
      "earth! How often did I imprecate curses on the cause of my being! The\n",
      "mildness of my nature had fled, and all within me was turned to gall\n",
      "and bitterness. The nearer I approached to your habitation, the more\n",
      "deeply did I feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart. Snow\n",
      "fell, and the waters were hardened, but I rested not. A few incidents\n",
      "now and then directed me, and I possessed a map of the country; but I\n",
      "often wandered wide from my path. The agony of my feelings allowed me\n",
      "no respite; no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could\n",
      "not extract its food; but a circumstance that happened when I arrived\n",
      "on the confines of Switzerland, when the sun had recovered its warmth\n",
      "and the earth again began to look green, confirmed in an especial\n",
      "manner the bitterness and horror of my feelings.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I generally rested during the day and travelled only when I was\n",
      "secured by night from the view of man. One morning, however, finding\n",
      "that my path lay through a deep wood, I ventured to continue my journey\n",
      "after the sun had risen; the day, which was one of the first of spring,\n",
      "cheered even me by the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of\n",
      "the air. I felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure, that had long\n",
      "appeared dead, revive within me. Half surprised by the novelty of\n",
      "these sensations, I allowed myself to be borne away by them, and\n",
      "forgetting my solitude and deformity, dared to be happy. Soft tears\n",
      "again bedewed my cheeks, and I even raised my humid eyes with\n",
      "thankfulness towards the blessed sun, which bestowed such joy upon me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I continued to wind among the paths of the wood, until I came to its\n",
      "boundary, which was skirted by a deep and rapid river, into which many\n",
      "of the trees bent their branches, now budding with the fresh spring.\n",
      "Here I paused, not exactly knowing what path to pursue, when I heard\n",
      "the sound of voices, that induced me to conceal myself under the shade\n",
      "of a cypress. I was scarcely hid when a young girl came running\n",
      "towards the spot where I was concealed, laughing, as if she ran from\n",
      "someone in sport. She continued her course along the precipitous sides\n",
      "of the river, when suddenly her foot slipped, and she fell into the\n",
      "rapid stream. I rushed from my hiding-place and with extreme labour,\n",
      "from the force of the current, saved her and dragged her to shore. She\n",
      "was senseless, and I endeavoured by every means in my power to restore\n",
      "animation, when I was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic,\n",
      "who was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled. On\n",
      "seeing me, he darted towards me, and tearing the girl from my arms,\n",
      "hastened towards the deeper parts of the wood. I followed speedily, I\n",
      "hardly knew why; but when the man saw me draw near, he aimed a gun,\n",
      "which he carried, at my body and fired. I sank to the ground, and my\n",
      "injurer, with increased swiftness, escaped into the wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This was then the reward of my benevolence! I had saved a human being\n",
      "from destruction, and as a recompense I now writhed under the miserable\n",
      "pain of a wound which shattered the flesh and bone. The feelings of\n",
      "kindness and gentleness which I had entertained but a few moments\n",
      "before gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth. Inflamed by\n",
      "pain, I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind. But the\n",
      "agony of my wound overcame me; my pulses paused, and I fainted.\n",
      "\n",
      "“For some weeks I led a miserable life in the woods, endeavouring to\n",
      "cure the wound which I had received. The ball had entered my shoulder,\n",
      "and I knew not whether it had remained there or passed through; at any\n",
      "rate I had no means of extracting it. My sufferings were augmented\n",
      "also by the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude of their\n",
      "infliction. My daily vows rose for revenge—a deep and deadly revenge,\n",
      "such as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish I had\n",
      "endured.\n",
      "\n",
      "“After some weeks my wound healed, and I continued my journey. The\n",
      "labours I endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or\n",
      "gentle breezes of spring; all joy was but a mockery which insulted my\n",
      "desolate state and made me feel more painfully that I was not made for\n",
      "the enjoyment of pleasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But my toils now drew near a close, and in two months from this time I\n",
      "reached the environs of Geneva.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was evening when I arrived, and I retired to a hiding-place among\n",
      "the fields that surround it to meditate in what manner I should apply\n",
      "to you. I was oppressed by fatigue and hunger and far too unhappy to\n",
      "enjoy the gentle breezes of evening or the prospect of the sun setting\n",
      "behind the stupendous mountains of Jura.\n",
      "\n",
      "“At this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflection,\n",
      "which was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child, who came\n",
      "running into the recess I had chosen, with all the sportiveness of\n",
      "infancy. Suddenly, as I gazed on him, an idea seized me that this\n",
      "little creature was unprejudiced and had lived too short a time to have\n",
      "imbibed a horror of deformity. If, therefore, I could seize him and\n",
      "educate him as my companion and friend, I should not be so desolate in\n",
      "this peopled earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Urged by this impulse, I seized on the boy as he passed and drew him\n",
      "towards me. As soon as he beheld my form, he placed his hands before\n",
      "his eyes and uttered a shrill scream; I drew his hand forcibly from his\n",
      "face and said, ‘Child, what is the meaning of this? I do not intend to\n",
      "hurt you; listen to me.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“He struggled violently. ‘Let me go,’ he cried;\n",
      "‘monster! Ugly wretch! You wish to eat me and tear me to pieces. You\n",
      "are an ogre. Let me go, or I will tell my papa.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘Boy, you will never see your father again; you must come with me.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘Hideous monster! Let me go. My papa is a syndic—he is M.\n",
      "Frankenstein—he will punish you. You dare not keep me.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘Frankenstein! you belong then to my enemy—to him towards whom I have\n",
      "sworn eternal revenge; you shall be my first victim.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“The child still struggled and loaded me with epithets which carried\n",
      "despair to my heart; I grasped his throat to silence him, and in a\n",
      "moment he lay dead at my feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I gazed on my victim, and my heart swelled with exultation and hellish\n",
      "triumph; clapping my hands, I exclaimed, ‘I too can create desolation;\n",
      "my enemy is not invulnerable; this death will carry despair to him, and\n",
      "a thousand other miseries shall torment and destroy him.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“As I fixed my eyes on the child, I saw something glittering on his\n",
      "breast. I took it; it was a portrait of a most lovely woman. In spite\n",
      "of my malignity, it softened and attracted me. For a few moments I\n",
      "gazed with delight on her dark eyes, fringed by deep lashes, and her\n",
      "lovely lips; but presently my rage returned; I remembered that I was\n",
      "for ever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could\n",
      "bestow and that she whose resemblance I contemplated would, in\n",
      "regarding me, have changed that air of divine benignity to one\n",
      "expressive of disgust and affright.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Can you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage? I only\n",
      "wonder that at that moment, instead of venting my sensations in\n",
      "exclamations and agony, I did not rush among mankind and perish in the\n",
      "attempt to destroy them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“While I was overcome by these feelings, I left the spot where I had\n",
      "committed the murder, and seeking a more secluded hiding-place, I\n",
      "entered a barn which had appeared to me to be empty. A woman was\n",
      "sleeping on some straw; she was young, not indeed so beautiful as her\n",
      "whose portrait I held, but of an agreeable aspect and blooming in the\n",
      "loveliness of youth and health. Here, I thought, is one of those whose\n",
      "joy-imparting smiles are bestowed on all but me. And then I bent over\n",
      "her and whispered, ‘Awake, fairest, thy lover is near—he who would\n",
      "give his life but to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes; my\n",
      "beloved, awake!’\n",
      "\n",
      "“The sleeper stirred; a thrill of terror ran through me. Should she\n",
      "indeed awake, and see me, and curse me, and denounce the murderer? Thus\n",
      "would she assuredly act if her darkened eyes opened and she beheld me.\n",
      "The thought was madness; it stirred the fiend within me—not I, but\n",
      "she, shall suffer; the murder I have committed because I am for ever\n",
      "robbed of all that she could give me, she shall atone. The crime had\n",
      "its source in her; be hers the punishment! Thanks to the lessons of\n",
      "Felix and the sanguinary laws of man, I had learned now to work\n",
      "mischief. I bent over her and placed the portrait securely in one of\n",
      "the folds of her dress. She moved again, and I fled.\n",

      "“For some days I haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place,\n",

      "and have ranged through their immense recesses, consumed by a burning\n",

      "promised to comply with my requisition. I am alone and miserable; man\n",

      "intercourse with those I loved. I knew that a thousand fearful\n",

      "thrill all connected with me with horror. I was aware also that I\n",
      "should often lose all self-command, all capacity of hiding the\n",

      "clothed my desires under a guise which excited no suspicion, while I\n",
      "urged my desire with an earnestness that easily induced my father to\n",
      "comply. After so long a period of an absorbing melancholy that\n",
      "resembled madness in its intensity and effects, he was glad to find\n",

      "precaution he had taken to ensure my having a companion. Without\n",
      "previously communicating with me, he had, in concert with Elizabeth,\n",
      "arranged that Clerval should join me at Strasburgh. This interfered\n",
      "with the solitude I coveted for the prosecution of my task; yet at the\n",
      "commencement of my journey the presence of my friend could in no way be\n",
      "an impediment, and truly I rejoiced that thus I should be saved many\n",
      "hours of lonely, maddening reflection. Nay, Henry might stand between\n",

      "unprotected from his attacks, exasperated as he might be by my\n",
      "departure. But he had promised to follow me wherever I might go, and\n",
      "would he not accompany me to England? This imagination was dreadful in\n",
      "itself, but soothing inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my friends.\n",
      "I was agonised with the idea of the possibility that the reverse of\n",
      "this might happen. But through the whole period during which I was the\n",
      "slave of my creature I allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of\n",
      "the moment; and my present sensations strongly intimated that the fiend\n",

      "\n",
      "It was in the latter end of September that I again quitted my native\n",
      "country. My journey had been my own suggestion, and Elizabeth\n",
      "therefore acquiesced, but she was filled with disquiet at the idea of\n",
      "my suffering, away from her, the inroads of misery and grief. It had\n",
      "been her care which provided me a companion in Clerval—and yet a man\n",
      "is blind to a thousand minute circumstances which call forth a woman’s\n",
      "sedulous attention. She longed to bid me hasten my return; a thousand\n",
      "conflicting emotions rendered her mute as she bade me a tearful, silent\n",
      "farewell.\n",

      "I threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away, hardly\n",
      "knowing whither I was going, and careless of what was passing around.\n",
      "I remembered only, and it was with a bitter anguish that I reflected on\n",
      "it, to order that my chemical instruments should be packed to go with\n",
      "me. Filled with dreary imaginations, I passed through many beautiful\n",
      "and majestic scenes, but my eyes were fixed and unobserving. I could\n",
      "only think of the bourne of my travels and the work which was to occupy\n",

      "was alive to every new scene, joyful when he saw the beauties of the\n",
      "setting sun, and more happy when he beheld it rise and recommence a new\n",
      "day. He pointed out to me the shifting colours of the landscape and\n",
      "the appearances of the sky. “This is what it is to live,” he cried;\n",
      "“now I enjoy existence! But you, my dear Frankenstein, wherefore are\n",
      "you desponding and sorrowful!” In truth, I was occupied by gloomy\n",
      "thoughts and neither saw the descent of the evening star nor the golden\n",
      "sunrise reflected in the Rhine. And you, my friend, would be far more\n",
      "amused with the journal of Clerval, who observed the scenery with an\n",
      "eye of feeling and delight, than in listening to my reflections. I, a\n",
      "miserable wretch, haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to\n",

      "\n",
      "We had agreed to descend the Rhine in a boat from Strasburgh to\n",

      "We stayed a day at Mannheim, and on the fifth from our departure from\n",
      "Strasburgh, arrived at Mainz. The course of the Rhine below Mainz\n",
      "becomes much more picturesque. The river descends rapidly and winds\n",
      "between hills, not high, but steep, and of beautiful forms. We saw\n",
      "many ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices, surrounded by\n",
      "black woods, high and inaccessible. This part of the Rhine, indeed,\n",
      "presents a singularly variegated landscape. In one spot you view\n",
      "rugged hills, ruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices, with\n",
      "the dark Rhine rushing beneath; and on the sudden turn of a promontory,\n",
      "flourishing vineyards with green sloping banks and a meandering river\n",

      "\n",
      "We travelled at the time of the vintage and heard the song of the labourers\n",
      "as we glided down the stream. Even I, depressed in mind, and my spirits\n",
      "continually agitated by gloomy feelings, even I was pleased. I lay at the\n",
      "bottom of the boat, and as I gazed on the cloudless blue sky, I seemed to\n",
      "drink in a tranquillity to which I had long been a stranger. And if these\n",
      "were my sensations, who can describe those of Henry? He felt as if he had\n",
      "been transported to Fairy-land and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by\n",
      "man. “I have seen,” he said, “the most beautiful scenes\n",
      "of my own country; I have visited the lakes of Lucerne and Uri, where the\n",
      "snowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water, casting black\n",
      "and impenetrable shades, which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance\n",
      "were it not for the most verdant islands that relieve the eye by their gay\n",
      "appearance; I have seen this lake agitated by a tempest, when the wind tore\n",
      "up whirlwinds of water and gave you an idea of what the water-spout must be\n",
      "on the great ocean; and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain,\n",
      "where the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche and\n",
      "where their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the\n",
      "nightly wind; I have seen the mountains of La Valais, and the Pays de Vaud;\n",
      "but this country, Victor, pleases me more than all those wonders. The\n",
      "mountains of Switzerland are more majestic and strange, but there is a\n",
      "charm in the banks of this divine river that I never before saw equalled.\n",
      "Look at that castle which overhangs yon precipice; and that also on the\n",
      "island, almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees; and now\n",
      "that group of labourers coming from among their vines; and that village\n",
      "half hid in the recess of the mountain. Oh, surely the spirit that inhabits\n",
      "and guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man than those who\n",

      "taken of its society, the means of materially assisting the progress of\n",
      "European colonization and trade. In Britain only could he further the\n",
      "execution of his plan. He was for ever busy, and the only check to his\n",
      "enjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind. I tried to conceal this\n",
      "as much as possible, that I might not debar him from the pleasures\n",
      "natural to one who was entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed by\n",
      "any care or bitter recollection. I often refused to accompany him,\n",
      "alleging another engagement, that I might remain alone. I now also\n",
      "began to collect the materials necessary for my new creation, and this\n",
      "was to me like the torture of single drops of water continually falling\n",

      "We had arrived in England at the beginning of October, and it was now\n",

      "intend to follow the great road to Edinburgh, but to visit Windsor, Oxford,\n",
      "Matlock, and the Cumberland lakes, resolving to arrive at the completion of\n",
      "this tour about the end of July. I packed up my chemical instruments and\n",

      "stately deer were all novelties to us.\n",
      "\n",
      "From thence we proceeded to Oxford. As we entered this city, our minds\n",
      "were filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted\n",
      "there more than a century and a half before. It was here that Charles\n",
      "I. had collected his forces. This city had remained faithful to him,\n",
      "after the whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of\n",
      "Parliament and liberty. The memory of that unfortunate king and his\n",
      "companions, the amiable Falkland, the insolent Goring, his queen, and\n",
      "son, gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city which they\n",
      "might be supposed to have inhabited. The spirit of elder days found a\n",
      "dwelling here, and we delighted to trace its footsteps. If these\n",
      "feelings had not found an imaginary gratification, the appearance of\n",
      "the city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration.\n",
      "The colleges are ancient and picturesque; the streets are almost\n",
      "magnificent; and the lovely Isis, which flows beside it through meadows\n",
      "of exquisite verdure, is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters,\n",
      "which reflects its majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, and\n",
      "domes, embosomed among aged trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "I enjoyed this scene, and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the\n",
      "memory of the past and the anticipation of the future. I was formed\n",
      "for peaceful happiness. During my youthful days discontent never\n",
      "visited my mind, and if I was ever overcome by _ennui_, the sight of what\n",
      "is beautiful in nature or the study of what is excellent and sublime in\n",
      "the productions of man could always interest my heart and communicate\n",
      "elasticity to my spirits. But I am a blasted tree; the bolt has\n",
      "entered my soul; and I felt then that I should survive to exhibit what\n",
      "I shall soon cease to be—a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity,\n",
      "pitiable to others and intolerable to myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "We passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling among its environs\n",
      "and endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most\n",
      "animating epoch of English history. Our little voyages of discovery\n",
      "were often prolonged by the successive objects that presented\n",
      "themselves. We visited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden and the\n",
      "field on which that patriot fell. For a moment my soul was elevated\n",
      "from its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas\n",
      "of liberty and self-sacrifice of which these sights were the monuments\n",
      "and the remembrancers. For an instant I dared to shake off my chains\n",
      "and look around me with a free and lofty spirit, but the iron had eaten\n",
      "into my flesh, and I sank again, trembling and hopeless, into my\n",
      "miserable self.\n",
      "\n",
      "We left Oxford with regret and proceeded to Matlock, which was our next\n",
      "place of rest. The country in the neighbourhood of this village\n",
      "resembled, to a greater degree, the scenery of Switzerland; but\n",
      "everything is on a lower scale, and the green hills want the crown of\n",
      "distant white Alps which always attend on the piny mountains of my\n",
      "native country. We visited the wondrous cave and the little cabinets\n",
      "of natural history, where the curiosities are disposed in the same\n",
      "manner as in the collections at Servox and Chamounix. The latter name\n",
      "made me tremble when pronounced by Henry, and I hastened to quit\n",
      "Matlock, with which that terrible scene was thus associated.\n",
      "\n",
      "From Derby, still journeying northwards, we passed two months in\n",
      "Cumberland and Westmorland. I could now almost fancy myself among the\n",
      "Swiss mountains. The little patches of snow which yet lingered on the\n",
      "northern sides of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the\n",
      "rocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me. Here also we\n",
      "made some acquaintances, who almost contrived to cheat me into\n",
      "happiness. The delight of Clerval was proportionably greater than\n",
      "mine; his mind expanded in the company of men of talent, and he found\n",
      "in his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have\n",
      "imagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his\n",
      "inferiors. “I could pass my life here,” said he to me; “and among\n",
      "these mountains I should scarcely regret Switzerland and the Rhine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But he found that a traveller’s life is one that includes much pain\n",
      "amidst its enjoyments. His feelings are for ever on the stretch; and\n",
      "when he begins to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quit\n",
      "that on which he rests in pleasure for something new, which again\n",
      "engages his attention, and which also he forsakes for other novelties.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland and Westmorland\n",
      "and conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants when the period\n",
      "of our appointment with our Scotch friend approached, and we left them\n",
      "to travel on. For my own part I was not sorry. I had now neglected my\n",
      "promise for some time, and I feared the effects of the dæmon’s\n",
      "disappointment. He might remain in Switzerland and wreak his vengeance\n",
      "on my relatives. This idea pursued me and tormented me at every moment\n",
      "from which I might otherwise have snatched repose and peace. I waited\n",
      "for my letters with feverish impatience; if they were delayed I was\n",
      "miserable and overcome by a thousand fears; and when they arrived and I\n",
      "saw the superscription of Elizabeth or my father, I hardly dared to\n",
      "read and ascertain my fate. Sometimes I thought that the fiend\n",
      "followed me and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion.\n",
      "When these thoughts possessed me, I would not quit Henry for a moment,\n",
      "but followed him as his shadow, to protect him from the fancied rage of\n",
      "his destroyer. I felt as if I had committed some great crime, the\n",
      "consciousness of which haunted me. I was guiltless, but I had indeed\n",
      "drawn down a horrible curse upon my head, as mortal as that of crime.\n",
      "\n",
      "I visited Edinburgh with languid eyes and mind; and yet that city might\n",
      "have interested the most unfortunate being. Clerval did not like it so well\n",
      "as Oxford, for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him.\n",
      "But the beauty and regularity of the new town of Edinburgh, its romantic\n",
      "castle and its environs, the most delightful in the world, Arthur’s\n",
      "Seat, St. Bernard’s Well, and the Pentland Hills, compensated him for\n",
      "the change and filled him with cheerfulness and admiration. But I was\n",
      "impatient to arrive at the termination of my journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "We left Edinburgh in a week, passing through Coupar, St. Andrew’s, and\n",
      "along the banks of the Tay, to Perth, where our friend expected us.\n",
      "But I was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers or enter into\n",
      "their feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest; and\n",
      "accordingly I told Clerval that I wished to make the tour of Scotland\n",
      "alone. “Do you,” said I, “enjoy yourself, and let this be our\n",
      "rendezvous. I may be absent a month or two; but do not interfere with\n",
      "my motions, I entreat you; leave me to peace and solitude for a short\n",
      "time; and when I return, I hope it will be with a lighter heart, more\n",
      "congenial to your own temper.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Henry wished to dissuade me, but seeing me bent on this plan, ceased to\n",
      "remonstrate. He entreated me to write often. “I had rather be with\n",
      "you,” he said, “in your solitary rambles, than with these Scotch\n",
      "people, whom I do not know; hasten, then, my dear friend, to return,\n",

      "Having parted from my friend, I determined to visit some remote spot of\n",

      "finished, that he might receive his companion.\n",
      "\n",
      "With this resolution I traversed the northern highlands and fixed on one of\n",
      "the remotest of the Orkneys as the scene of my labours. It was a place\n",
      "fitted for such a work, being hardly more than a rock whose high sides were\n",
      "continually beaten upon by the waves. The soil was barren, scarcely\n",
      "affording pasture for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal for its\n",
      "inhabitants, which consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and scraggy limbs\n",
      "gave tokens of their miserable fare. Vegetables and bread, when they\n",
      "indulged in such luxuries, and even fresh water, was to be procured from\n",
      "the mainland, which was about five miles distant.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the whole island there were but three miserable huts, and one of\n",
      "these was vacant when I arrived. This I hired. It contained but two\n",
      "rooms, and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable\n",
      "penury. The thatch had fallen in, the walls were unplastered, and the\n",
      "door was off its hinges. I ordered it to be repaired, bought some\n",
      "furniture, and took possession, an incident which would doubtless have\n",
      "occasioned some surprise had not all the senses of the cottagers been\n",
      "benumbed by want and squalid poverty. As it was, I lived ungazed at\n",
      "and unmolested, hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes\n",
      "which I gave, so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations\n",
      "of men.\n",

      "In this retreat I devoted the morning to labour; but in the evening,\n",
      "when the weather permitted, I walked on the stony beach of the sea to\n",
      "listen to the waves as they roared and dashed at my feet. It was a\n",
      "monotonous yet ever-changing scene. I thought of Switzerland; it was\n",
      "far different from this desolate and appalling landscape. Its hills\n",
      "are covered with vines, and its cottages are scattered thickly in the\n",
      "plains. Its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky, and when\n",
      "troubled by the winds, their tumult is but as the play of a lively\n",

      "In this manner I distributed my occupations when I first arrived, but\n",
      "as I proceeded in my labour, it became every day more horrible and\n",
      "irksome to me. Sometimes I could not prevail on myself to enter my\n",
      "laboratory for several days, and at other times I toiled day and night\n",
      "in order to complete my work. It was, indeed, a filthy process in\n",
      "which I was engaged. During my first experiment, a kind of\n",
      "enthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my employment; my\n",
      "mind was intently fixed on the consummation of my labour, and my eyes\n",

      "Thus situated, employed in the most detestable occupation, immersed in\n",
      "a solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from\n",

      "grew restless and nervous. Every moment I feared to meet my\n",
      "persecutor. Sometimes I sat with my eyes fixed on the ground, fearing\n",
      "to raise them lest they should encounter the object which I so much\n",

      "Man! You may hate, but beware! Your hours will pass in dread and misery,\n",
      "and soon the bolt will fall which must ravish from you your happiness for\n",
      "ever. Are you to be happy while I grovel in the intensity of my\n",
      "wretchedness? You can blast my other passions, but revenge\n",

      "first you, my tyrant and tormentor, shall curse the sun that gazes on your\n",

      "The night passed away, and the sun rose from the ocean; my feelings became\n",
      "calmer, if it may be called calmness when the violence of rage sinks into\n",
      "the depths of despair. I left the house, the horrid scene of the last\n",
      "night’s contention, and walked on the beach of the sea, which I\n",
      "almost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my fellow\n",
      "creatures; nay, a wish that such should prove the fact stole across me. I\n",
      "desired that I might pass my life on that barren rock, wearily, it is true,\n",
      "but uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery. If I returned, it was to\n",
      "be sacrificed or to see those whom I most loved die under the grasp of a\n",

      "\n",
      "I walked about the isle like a restless spectre, separated from all it\n",

      "sleep. I had been awake the whole of the preceding night, my nerves\n",
      "were agitated, and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery. The sleep\n",
      "into which I now sank refreshed me; and when I awoke, I again felt as\n",
      "if I belonged to a race of human beings like myself, and I began to\n",
      "reflect upon what had passed with greater composure; yet still the\n",
      "words of the fiend rang in my ears like a death-knell; they appeared\n",
      "like a dream, yet distinct and oppressive as a reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sun had far descended, and I still sat on the shore, satisfying my\n",
      "appetite, which had become ravenous, with an oaten cake, when I saw a\n",
      "fishing-boat land close to me, and one of the men brought me a packet;\n",
      "it contained letters from Geneva, and one from Clerval entreating me to\n",
      "join him. He said that he was wearing away his time fruitlessly where\n",
      "he was, that letters from the friends he had formed in London desired\n",
      "his return to complete the negotiation they had entered into for his\n",
      "Indian enterprise. He could not any longer delay his departure; but as\n",
      "his journey to London might be followed, even sooner than he now\n",
      "conjectured, by his longer voyage, he entreated me to bestow as much of\n",
      "my society on him as I could spare. He besought me, therefore, to\n",
      "leave my solitary isle and to meet him at Perth, that we might proceed\n",
      "southwards together. This letter in a degree recalled me to life, and\n",
      "I determined to quit my island at the expiration of two days.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, before I departed, there was a task to perform, on which I shuddered\n",
      "to reflect; I must pack up my chemical instruments, and for that purpose I\n",
      "must enter the room which had been the scene of my odious work, and I must\n",
      "handle those utensils the sight of which was sickening to me. The next\n",
      "morning, at daybreak, I summoned sufficient courage and unlocked the door\n",
      "of my laboratory. The remains of the half-finished creature, whom I had\n",
      "destroyed, lay scattered on the floor, and I almost felt as if I had\n",
      "mangled the living flesh of a human being. I paused to collect myself and\n",
      "then entered the chamber. With trembling hand I conveyed the instruments\n",
      "out of the room, but I reflected that I ought not to leave the relics of my\n",
      "work to excite the horror and suspicion of the peasants; and I accordingly\n",
      "put them into a basket, with a great quantity of stones, and laying them\n",
      "up, determined to throw them into the sea that very night; and in the\n",
      "meantime I sat upon the beach, employed in cleaning and arranging my\n",
      "chemical apparatus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place\n",
      "in my feelings since the night of the appearance of the dæmon. I had\n",
      "before regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that, with\n",
      "whatever consequences, must be fulfilled; but I now felt as if a film\n",
      "had been taken from before my eyes and that I for the first time saw\n",
      "clearly. The idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur\n",
      "to me; the threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts, but I did not\n",
      "reflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it. I had resolved in\n",
      "my own mind that to create another like the fiend I had first made\n",
      "would be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness, and I\n",
      "banished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different\n",
      "conclusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Between two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then, putting my\n",
      "basket aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the shore.\n",
      "The scene was perfectly solitary; a few boats were returning towards land,\n",
      "but I sailed away from them. I felt as if I was about the commission of a\n",
      "dreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter with my\n",
      "fellow creatures. At one time the moon, which had before been clear, was\n",
      "suddenly overspread by a thick cloud, and I took advantage of the moment of\n",
      "darkness and cast my basket into the sea; I listened to the gurgling sound\n",
      "as it sank and then sailed away from the spot. The sky became clouded, but\n",
      "the air was pure, although chilled by the northeast breeze that was then\n",
      "rising. But it refreshed me and filled me with such agreeable sensations\n",
      "that I resolved to prolong my stay on the water, and fixing the rudder in a\n",
      "direct position, stretched myself at the bottom of the boat. Clouds hid the\n",
      "moon, everything was obscure, and I heard only the sound of the boat as its\n",
      "keel cut through the waves; the murmur lulled me, and in a short time I\n",
      "slept soundly.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not know how long I remained in this situation, but when I awoke I\n",
      "found that the sun had already mounted considerably. The wind was high, and\n",
      "the waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff. I found\n",
      "that the wind was northeast and must have driven me far from the coast from\n",
      "which I had embarked. I endeavoured to change my course but quickly found\n",
      "that if I again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with\n",
      "water. Thus situated, my only resource was to drive before the wind. I\n",
      "confess that I felt a few sensations of terror. I had no compass with me\n",
      "and was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the\n",
      "world that the sun was of little benefit to me. I might be driven into the\n",
      "wide Atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up in\n",
      "the immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me. I had already\n",
      "been out many hours and felt the torment of a burning thirst, a prelude to\n",
      "my other sufferings. I looked on the heavens, which were covered by clouds\n",
      "that flew before the wind, only to be replaced by others; I looked upon the\n",
      "sea; it was to be my grave. “Fiend,” I exclaimed, “your\n",
      "task is already fulfilled!” I thought of Elizabeth, of my father, and\n",
      "of Clerval—all left behind, on whom the monster might satisfy his\n",
      "sanguinary and merciless passions. This idea plunged me into a reverie so\n",
      "despairing and frightful that even now, when the scene is on the point of\n",
      "closing before me for ever, I shudder to reflect on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some hours passed thus; but by degrees, as the sun declined towards the\n",
      "horizon, the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea became\n",
      "free from breakers. But these gave place to a heavy swell; I felt sick\n",
      "and hardly able to hold the rudder, when suddenly I saw a line of high\n",
      "land towards the south.\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost spent, as I was, by fatigue and the dreadful suspense I endured\n",
      "for several hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of\n",
      "warm joy to my heart, and tears gushed from my eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "How mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we have\n",
      "of life even in the excess of misery! I constructed another sail with a\n",
      "part of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land. It had a\n",
      "wild and rocky appearance, but as I approached nearer I easily perceived\n",
      "the traces of cultivation. I saw vessels near the shore and found myself\n",
      "suddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilised man. I\n",
      "carefully traced the windings of the land and hailed a steeple which I at\n",
      "length saw issuing from behind a small promontory. As I was in a state of\n",
      "extreme debility, I resolved to sail directly towards the town, as a place\n",
      "where I could most easily procure nourishment. Fortunately I had money with\n",
      "me. As I turned the promontory I perceived a small neat town and a good\n",
      "harbour, which I entered, my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected\n",
      "escape.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails, several\n",
      "people crowded towards the spot. They seemed much surprised at my\n",
      "appearance, but instead of offering me any assistance, whispered\n",
      "together with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me\n",
      "a slight sensation of alarm. As it was, I merely remarked that they\n",
      "spoke English, and I therefore addressed them in that language. “My\n",
      "good friends,” said I, “will you be so kind as to tell me the name of\n",
      "this town and inform me where I am?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You will know that soon enough,” replied a man with a hoarse voice.\n",
      "“Maybe you are come to a place that will not prove much to your taste,\n",
      "but you will not be consulted as to your quarters, I promise you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a\n",
      "stranger, and I was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and\n",
      "angry countenances of his companions. “Why do you answer me so\n",
      "roughly?” I replied. “Surely it is not the custom of Englishmen to\n",
      "receive strangers so inhospitably.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not know,” said the man, “what the custom of the\n",
      "English may be, but it is the custom of the Irish to hate villains.”\n",
      "\n",
      "While this strange dialogue continued, I perceived the crowd rapidly\n",
      "increase. Their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger, which\n",
      "annoyed and in some degree alarmed me. I inquired the way to the inn, but\n",
      "no one replied. I then moved forward, and a murmuring sound arose from the\n",
      "crowd as they followed and surrounded me, when an ill-looking man\n",
      "approaching tapped me on the shoulder and said, “Come, sir, you must\n",
      "follow me to Mr. Kirwin’s to give an account of yourself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who is Mr. Kirwin? Why am I to give an account of myself? Is not\n",
      "this a free country?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ay, sir, free enough for honest folks. Mr. Kirwin is a magistrate,\n",
      "and you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was\n",
      "found murdered here last night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This answer startled me, but I presently recovered myself. I was innocent;\n",
      "that could easily be proved; accordingly I followed my conductor in silence\n",
      "and was led to one of the best houses in the town. I was ready to sink from\n",
      "fatigue and hunger, but being surrounded by a crowd, I thought it politic\n",
      "to rouse all my strength, that no physical debility might be construed into\n",
      "apprehension or conscious guilt. Little did I then expect the calamity that\n",
      "was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair\n",
      "all fear of ignominy or death.\n",
      "\n",
      "I must pause here, for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory of\n",
      "the frightful events which I am about to relate, in proper detail, to my\n",
      "recollection.\n",

      "I was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate, an old\n",
      "benevolent man with calm and mild manners. He looked upon me, however,\n",
      "with some degree of severity, and then, turning towards my conductors,\n",
      "he asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "About half a dozen men came forward; and, one being selected by the\n",
      "magistrate, he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with\n",
      "his son and brother-in-law, Daniel Nugent, when, about ten o’clock,\n",
      "they observed a strong northerly blast rising, and they accordingly put in\n",
      "for port. It was a very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen; they did\n",
      "not land at the harbour, but, as they had been accustomed, at a creek about\n",
      "two miles below. He walked on first, carrying a part of the fishing tackle,\n",
      "and his companions followed him at some distance. As he was proceeding\n",
      "along the sands, he struck his foot against something and fell at his\n",
      "length on the ground. His companions came up to assist him, and by the\n",
      "light of their lantern they found that he had fallen on the body of a man,\n",
      "who was to all appearance dead. Their first supposition was that it was the\n",
      "corpse of some person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the\n",
      "waves, but on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and even\n",
      "that the body was not then cold. They instantly carried it to the cottage\n",
      "of an old woman near the spot and endeavoured, but in vain, to restore it\n",
      "to life. It appeared to be a handsome young man, about five and twenty\n",
      "years of age. He had apparently been strangled, for there was no sign of\n",
      "any violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me, but\n",
      "when the mark of the fingers was mentioned I remembered the murder of\n",
      "my brother and felt myself extremely agitated; my limbs trembled, and a\n",
      "mist came over my eyes, which obliged me to lean on a chair for\n",
      "support. The magistrate observed me with a keen eye and of course drew\n",
      "an unfavourable augury from my manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "The son confirmed his father’s account, but when Daniel Nugent was\n",
      "called he swore positively that just before the fall of his companion, he\n",
      "saw a boat, with a single man in it, at a short distance from the shore;\n",
      "and as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars, it was the same\n",
      "boat in which I had just landed.\n",
      "\n",
      "A woman deposed that she lived near the beach and was standing at the door\n",
      "of her cottage, waiting for the return of the fishermen, about an hour\n",
      "before she heard of the discovery of the body, when she saw a boat with\n",
      "only one man in it push off from that part of the shore where the corpse\n",
      "was afterwards found.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the\n",
      "body into her house; it was not cold. They put it into a bed and\n",
      "rubbed it, and Daniel went to the town for an apothecary, but life was\n",
      "quite gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several other men were examined concerning my landing, and they agreed\n",
      "that, with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night, it\n",
      "was very probable that I had beaten about for many hours and had been\n",
      "obliged to return nearly to the same spot from which I had departed.\n",
      "Besides, they observed that it appeared that I had brought the body\n",
      "from another place, and it was likely that as I did not appear to know\n",
      "the shore, I might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance\n",
      "of the town of —— from the place where I had deposited the corpse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Kirwin, on hearing this evidence, desired that I should be taken into\n",
      "the room where the body lay for interment, that it might be observed what\n",
      "effect the sight of it would produce upon me. This idea was probably\n",
      "suggested by the extreme agitation I had exhibited when the mode of the\n",
      "murder had been described. I was accordingly conducted, by the magistrate\n",
      "and several other persons, to the inn. I could not help being struck by the\n",
      "strange coincidences that had taken place during this eventful night; but,\n",
      "knowing that I had been conversing with several persons in the island I had\n",
      "inhabited about the time that the body had been found, I was perfectly\n",
      "tranquil as to the consequences of the affair.\n",

      "horror, nor can I reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering and\n",
      "agony. The examination, the presence of the magistrate and witnesses,\n",
      "passed like a dream from my memory when I saw the lifeless form of Henry\n",
      "Clerval stretched before me. I gasped for breath, and throwing myself on\n",
      "the body, I exclaimed, “Have my murderous machinations deprived you\n",
      "also, my dearest Henry, of life? Two I have already destroyed; other\n",
      "victims await their destiny; but you, Clerval, my friend, my\n",
      "benefactor—”\n",
      "\n",
      "The human frame could no longer support the agonies that I endured, and\n",
      "I was carried out of the room in strong convulsions.\n",
      "\n",
      "A fever succeeded to this. I lay for two months on the point of death; my\n",
      "ravings, as I afterwards heard, were frightful; I called myself the\n",
      "murderer of William, of Justine, and of Clerval. Sometimes I entreated my\n",
      "attendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom I was\n",
      "tormented; and at others I felt the fingers of the monster already grasping\n",
      "my neck, and screamed aloud with agony and terror. Fortunately, as I spoke\n",
      "my native language, Mr. Kirwin alone understood me; but my gestures and\n",
      "bitter cries were sufficient to affright the other witnesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why did I not die? More miserable than man ever was before, why did I not\n",
      "sink into forgetfulness and rest? Death snatches away many blooming\n",
      "children, the only hopes of their doting parents; how many brides and\n",
      "youthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope, and the\n",
      "next a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb! Of what materials was I\n",
      "made that I could thus resist so many shocks, which, like the turning of\n",
      "the wheel, continually renewed the torture?\n",
      "\n",
      "But I was doomed to live and in two months found myself as awaking from\n",
      "a dream, in a prison, stretched on a wretched bed, surrounded by\n",
      "gaolers, turnkeys, bolts, and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon.\n",
      "It was morning, I remember, when I thus awoke to understanding; I had\n",
      "forgotten the particulars of what had happened and only felt as if some\n",
      "great misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me; but when I looked around\n",
      "and saw the barred windows and the squalidness of the room in which I\n",
      "was, all flashed across my memory and I groaned bitterly.\n",
      "\n",
      "This sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside\n",
      "me. She was a hired nurse, the wife of one of the turnkeys, and her\n",
      "countenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterise\n",
      "that class. The lines of her face were hard and rude, like that of\n",
      "persons accustomed to see without sympathising in sights of misery. Her\n",
      "tone expressed her entire indifference; she addressed me in English,\n",
      "and the voice struck me as one that I had heard during my sufferings.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you better now, sir?” said she.\n",
      "\n",
      "I replied in the same language, with a feeble voice, “I believe I am;\n",
      "but if it be all true, if indeed I did not dream, I am sorry that I am\n",
      "still alive to feel this misery and horror.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“For that matter,” replied the old woman, “if you mean about the\n",
      "gentleman you murdered, I believe that it were better for you if you\n",
      "were dead, for I fancy it will go hard with you! However, that’s none\n",
      "of my business; I am sent to nurse you and get you well; I do my duty\n",
      "with a safe conscience; it were well if everybody did the same.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a\n",
      "speech to a person just saved, on the very edge of death; but I felt\n",
      "languid and unable to reflect on all that had passed. The whole series\n",
      "of my life appeared to me as a dream; I sometimes doubted if indeed it\n",
      "were all true, for it never presented itself to my mind with the force\n",
      "of reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the images that floated before me became more distinct, I grew\n",
      "feverish; a darkness pressed around me; no one was near me who soothed\n",
      "me with the gentle voice of love; no dear hand supported me. The\n",
      "physician came and prescribed medicines, and the old woman prepared\n",
      "them for me; but utter carelessness was visible in the first, and the\n",
      "expression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of the\n",
      "second. Who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the\n",
      "hangman who would gain his fee?\n",
      "\n",
      "These were my first reflections, but I soon learned that Mr. Kirwin had\n",
      "shown me extreme kindness. He had caused the best room in the prison\n",
      "to be prepared for me (wretched indeed was the best); and it was he who\n",
      "had provided a physician and a nurse. It is true, he seldom came to\n",
      "see me, for although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of\n",
      "every human creature, he did not wish to be present at the agonies and\n",
      "miserable ravings of a murderer. He came, therefore, sometimes to see\n",
      "that I was not neglected, but his visits were short and with long\n",
      "intervals.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, while I was gradually recovering, I was seated in a chair, my eyes\n",
      "half open and my cheeks livid like those in death. I was overcome by gloom\n",
      "and misery and often reflected I had better seek death than desire to\n",
      "remain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness. At one time I\n",
      "considered whether I should not declare myself guilty and suffer the\n",
      "penalty of the law, less innocent than poor Justine had been. Such were my\n",
      "thoughts when the door of my apartment was opened and Mr. Kirwin entered.\n",
      "His countenance expressed sympathy and compassion; he drew a chair close to\n",
      "mine and addressed me in French,\n",
      "\n",
      "“I fear that this place is very shocking to you; can I do anything to\n",
      "make you more comfortable?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thank you, but all that you mention is nothing to me; on the whole\n",
      "earth there is no comfort which I am capable of receiving.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to\n",
      "one borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune. But you will, I\n",
      "hope, soon quit this melancholy abode, for doubtless evidence can\n",
      "easily be brought to free you from the criminal charge.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is my least concern; I am, by a course of strange events, become\n",
      "the most miserable of mortals. Persecuted and tortured as I am and\n",
      "have been, can death be any evil to me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonising than the\n",
      "strange chances that have lately occurred. You were thrown, by some\n",
      "surprising accident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality,\n",
      "seized immediately, and charged with murder. The first sight that was\n",
      "presented to your eyes was the body of your friend, murdered in so\n",
      "unaccountable a manner and placed, as it were, by some fiend across\n",
      "your path.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As Mr. Kirwin said this, notwithstanding the agitation I endured on\n",
      "this retrospect of my sufferings, I also felt considerable surprise at\n",
      "the knowledge he seemed to possess concerning me. I suppose some\n",
      "astonishment was exhibited in my countenance, for Mr. Kirwin hastened\n",
      "to say,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Immediately upon your being taken ill, all the papers that were on\n",
      "your person were brought me, and I examined them that I might discover some\n",
      "trace by which I could send to your relations an account of your misfortune\n",
      "and illness. I found several letters, and, among others, one which I\n",
      "discovered from its commencement to be from your father. I instantly wrote\n",
      "to Geneva; nearly two months have elapsed since the departure of my letter.\n",
      "But you are ill; even now you tremble; you are unfit for agitation of any\n",
      "kind.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event;\n",
      "tell me what new scene of death has been acted, and whose murder I am\n",
      "now to lament?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your family is perfectly well,” said Mr. Kirwin with\n",
      "gentleness; “and someone, a friend, is come to visit you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself, but it\n",
      "instantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my\n",
      "misery and taunt me with the death of Clerval, as a new incitement for\n",
      "me to comply with his hellish desires. I put my hand before my eyes,\n",
      "and cried out in agony,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! Take him away! I cannot see him; for God’s sake, do not\n",
      "let him enter!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance. He could not help\n",
      "regarding my exclamation as a presumption of my guilt and said in\n",
      "rather a severe tone,\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should have thought, young man, that the presence of your father\n",
      "would have been welcome instead of inspiring such violent repugnance.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My father!” cried I, while every feature and every muscle was relaxed\n",
      "from anguish to pleasure. “Is my father indeed come? How kind, how\n",
      "very kind! But where is he, why does he not hasten to me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "My change of manner surprised and pleased the magistrate; perhaps he\n",
      "thought that my former exclamation was a momentary return of delirium,\n",
      "and now he instantly resumed his former benevolence. He rose and\n",
      "quitted the room with my nurse, and in a moment my father entered it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing, at this moment, could have given me greater pleasure than the\n",
      "arrival of my father. I stretched out my hand to him and cried,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you then safe—and Elizabeth—and Ernest?”\n",
      "\n",
      "My father calmed me with assurances of their welfare and endeavoured, by\n",
      "dwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart, to raise my\n",
      "desponding spirits; but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode of\n",
      "cheerfulness. “What a place is this that you inhabit, my son!”\n",
      "said he, looking mournfully at the barred windows and wretched appearance\n",
      "of the room. “You travelled to seek happiness, but a fatality seems\n",
      "to pursue you. And poor Clerval—”\n",
      "\n",
      "The name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation too\n",
      "great to be endured in my weak state; I shed tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Alas! Yes, my father,” replied I; “some destiny of the\n",
      "most horrible kind hangs over me, and I must live to fulfil it, or surely I\n",
      "should have died on the coffin of Henry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We were not allowed to converse for any length of time, for the\n",
      "precarious state of my health rendered every precaution necessary that\n",
      "could ensure tranquillity. Mr. Kirwin came in and insisted that my\n",
      "strength should not be exhausted by too much exertion. But the\n",
      "appearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel, and I\n",
      "gradually recovered my health.\n",
      "\n",
      "As my sickness quitted me, I was absorbed by a gloomy and black\n",
      "melancholy that nothing could dissipate. The image of Clerval was\n",
      "for ever before me, ghastly and murdered. More than once the agitation\n",
      "into which these reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous\n",
      "relapse. Alas! Why did they preserve so miserable and detested a\n",
      "life? It was surely that I might fulfil my destiny, which is now\n",
      "drawing to a close. Soon, oh, very soon, will death extinguish these\n",
      "throbbings and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bears\n",
      "me to the dust; and, in executing the award of justice, I shall also\n",
      "sink to rest. Then the appearance of death was distant, although the\n",
      "wish was ever present to my thoughts; and I often sat for hours\n",
      "motionless and speechless, wishing for some mighty revolution that\n",
      "might bury me and my destroyer in its ruins.\n",
      "\n",
      "The season of the assizes approached. I had already been three months\n",
      "in prison, and although I was still weak and in continual danger of a\n",
      "relapse, I was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the country\n",
      "town where the court was held. Mr. Kirwin charged himself with every\n",
      "care of collecting witnesses and arranging my defence. I was spared\n",
      "the disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal, as the case was not\n",
      "brought before the court that decides on life and death. The grand\n",
      "jury rejected the bill, on its being proved that I was on the Orkney\n",
      "Islands at the hour the body of my friend was found; and a fortnight\n",
      "after my removal I was liberated from prison.\n",
      "\n",
      "My father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a\n",
      "criminal charge, that I was again allowed to breathe the fresh\n",
      "atmosphere and permitted to return to my native country. I did not\n",
      "participate in these feelings, for to me the walls of a dungeon or a\n",
      "palace were alike hateful. The cup of life was poisoned for ever, and\n",
      "although the sun shone upon me, as upon the happy and gay of heart, I\n",
      "saw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness, penetrated by\n",
      "no light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me. Sometimes\n",
      "they were the expressive eyes of Henry, languishing in death, the dark\n",
      "orbs nearly covered by the lids and the long black lashes that fringed\n",
      "them; sometimes it was the watery, clouded eyes of the monster, as I\n",
      "first saw them in my chamber at Ingolstadt.\n",
      "\n",
      "My father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection. He talked\n",
      "of Geneva, which I should soon visit, of Elizabeth and Ernest; but\n",
      "these words only drew deep groans from me. Sometimes, indeed, I felt a\n",
      "wish for happiness and thought with melancholy delight of my beloved\n",
      "cousin or longed, with a devouring _maladie du pays_, to see once more\n",
      "the blue lake and rapid Rhone, that had been so dear to me in early\n",
      "childhood; but my general state of feeling was a torpor in which a\n",
      "prison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene in nature; and\n",
      "these fits were seldom interrupted but by paroxysms of anguish and\n",
      "despair. At these moments I often endeavoured to put an end to the\n",
      "existence I loathed, and it required unceasing attendance and vigilance\n",
      "to restrain me from committing some dreadful act of violence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet one duty remained to me, the recollection of which finally\n",
      "triumphed over my selfish despair. It was necessary that I should\n",
      "return without delay to Geneva, there to watch over the lives of those\n",
      "I so fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer, that if any\n",
      "chance led me to the place of his concealment, or if he dared again to\n",
      "blast me by his presence, I might, with unfailing aim, put an end to\n",
      "the existence of the monstrous image which I had endued with the\n",
      "mockery of a soul still more monstrous. My father still desired to\n",
      "delay our departure, fearful that I could not sustain the fatigues of a\n",
      "journey, for I was a shattered wreck—the shadow of a human being. My\n",
      "strength was gone. I was a mere skeleton, and fever night and day\n",
      "preyed upon my wasted frame.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, as I urged our leaving Ireland with such inquietude and impatience,\n",
      "my father thought it best to yield. We took our passage on board a vessel\n",
      "bound for Havre-de-Grace and sailed with a fair wind from the Irish shores.\n",
      "It was midnight. I lay on the deck looking at the stars and listening to\n",
      "the dashing of the waves. I hailed the darkness that shut Ireland from my\n",
      "sight, and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when I reflected that I should\n",
      "soon see Geneva. The past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream;\n",
      "yet the vessel in which I was, the wind that blew me from the detested\n",
      "shore of Ireland, and the sea which surrounded me, told me too forcibly\n",
      "that I was deceived by no vision and that Clerval, my friend and dearest\n",
      "companion, had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation. I\n",
      "repassed, in my memory, my whole life; my quiet happiness while residing\n",
      "with my family in Geneva, the death of my mother, and my departure for\n",
      "Ingolstadt. I remembered, shuddering, the mad enthusiasm that hurried me on\n",
      "to the creation of my hideous enemy, and I called to mind the night in\n",
      "which he first lived. I was unable to pursue the train of thought; a\n",
      "thousand feelings pressed upon me, and I wept bitterly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ever since my recovery from the fever, I had been in the custom of taking\n",
      "every night a small quantity of laudanum, for it was by means of this drug\n",
      "only that I was enabled to gain the rest necessary for the preservation of\n",
      "life. Oppressed by the recollection of my various misfortunes, I now\n",
      "swallowed double my usual quantity and soon slept profoundly. But sleep did\n",
      "not afford me respite from thought and misery; my dreams presented a\n",
      "thousand objects that scared me. Towards morning I was possessed by a kind\n",
      "of nightmare; I felt the fiend’s grasp in my neck and could not free\n",
      "myself from it; groans and cries rang in my ears. My father, who was\n",
      "watching over me, perceiving my restlessness, awoke me; the dashing waves\n",
      "were around, the cloudy sky above, the fiend was not here: a sense of\n",
      "security, a feeling that a truce was established between the present hour\n",
      "and the irresistible, disastrous future imparted to me a kind of calm\n",
      "forgetfulness, of which the human mind is by its structure peculiarly\n",

      "attracted even to the most repulsive among them, as to creatures of an\n",

      "delirium, and that, during my illness, some idea of this kind had presented\n",
      "itself to my imagination, the remembrance of which I preserved in my\n",
      "convalescence. I avoided explanation and maintained a continual silence\n",
      "concerning the wretch I had created. I had a persuasion that I should be\n",

      "besides, I could not bring myself to disclose a secret which would fill my\n",

      "invincible, and that when he had pronounced the words “_I shall be with\n",
      "you on your wedding-night_,” I should regard the threatened fate as\n",
      "unavoidable. But death was no evil to me if the loss of Elizabeth were\n",

      "feelings by an appearance of hilarity that brought smiles and joy to the\n",
      "countenance of my father, but hardly deceived the ever-watchful and nicer\n",
      "eye of Elizabeth. She looked forward to our union with placid contentment,\n",
      "not unmingled with a little fear, which past misfortunes had impressed,\n",
      "that what now appeared certain and tangible happiness might soon dissipate\n",
      "into an airy dream and leave no trace but deep and everlasting regret.\n",
      "\n",

      "into the plans of my father, although they might only serve as the\n",
      "decorations of my tragedy. Through my father’s exertions a part of\n",
      "the inheritance of Elizabeth had been restored to her by the Austrian\n",
      "government. A small possession on the shores of Como belonged to her. It\n",
      "was agreed that, immediately after our union, we should proceed to Villa\n",
      "Lavenza and spend our first days of happiness beside the beautiful lake\n",
      "near which it stood.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime I took every precaution to defend my person in case the\n",
      "fiend should openly attack me. I carried pistols and a dagger\n",
      "constantly about me and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice, and\n",
      "by these means gained a greater degree of tranquillity. Indeed, as the\n",
      "period approached, the threat appeared more as a delusion, not to be\n",
      "regarded as worthy to disturb my peace, while the happiness I hoped for\n",
      "in my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty as the day fixed\n",
      "for its solemnisation drew nearer and I heard it continually spoken of\n",
      "as an occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent.\n",

      "Elizabeth seemed happy; my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly to\n",
      "calm her mind. But on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and my\n",
      "destiny, she was melancholy, and a presentiment of evil pervaded her;\n",
      "and perhaps also she thought of the dreadful secret which I had\n",
      "promised to reveal to her on the following day. My father was in the\n",
      "meantime overjoyed, and, in the bustle of preparation, only recognised in\n",

      "father’s, but it was agreed that Elizabeth and I should commence our\n",
      "journey by water, sleeping that night at Evian and continuing our\n",
      "voyage on the following day. The day was fair, the wind favourable;\n",
      "all smiled on our nuptial embarkation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those were the last moments of my life during which I enjoyed the\n",
      "feeling of happiness. We passed rapidly along; the sun was hot, but we\n",
      "were sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the\n",
      "beauty of the scene, sometimes on one side of the lake, where we saw\n",
      "Mont Salêve, the pleasant banks of Montalègre, and at a distance,\n",
      "surmounting all, the beautiful Mont Blanc, and the assemblage of snowy\n",
      "mountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her; sometimes coasting the\n",
      "opposite banks, we saw the mighty Jura opposing its dark side to the\n",
      "ambition that would quit its native country, and an almost\n",
      "insurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I took the hand of Elizabeth. “You are sorrowful, my love. Ah! If\n",
      "you knew what I have suffered and what I may yet endure, you would\n",
      "endeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that this\n",
      "one day at least permits me to enjoy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Be happy, my dear Victor,” replied Elizabeth; “there is, I hope,\n",
      "nothing to distress you; and be assured that if a lively joy is not\n",
      "painted in my face, my heart is contented. Something whispers to me\n",
      "not to depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us, but I\n",
      "will not listen to such a sinister voice. Observe how fast we move\n",
      "along and how the clouds, which sometimes obscure and sometimes rise\n",
      "above the dome of Mont Blanc, render this scene of beauty still more\n",
      "interesting. Look also at the innumerable fish that are swimming in\n",
      "the clear waters, where we can distinguish every pebble that lies at\n",

      "to distraction and reverie.\n",

      "The sun sank lower in the heavens; we passed the river Drance and\n",
      "observed its path through the chasms of the higher and the glens of the\n",
      "lower hills. The Alps here come closer to the lake, and we approached\n",
      "the amphitheatre of mountains which forms its eastern boundary. The\n",

      "of mountain above mountain by which it was overhung.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wind, which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity,\n",
      "sank at sunset to a light breeze; the soft air just ruffled the water\n",
      "and caused a pleasant motion among the trees as we approached the\n",
      "shore, from which it wafted the most delightful scent of flowers and\n",
      "hay. The sun sank beneath the horizon as we landed, and as I touched\n",

      "The wind, which had fallen in the south, now rose with great violence\n",

      "my bosom; every sound terrified me, but I resolved that I would sell my\n",

      "of my adversary was extinguished.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence,\n",
      "but there was something in my glance which communicated terror to her, and\n",

      "my adversary. But I discovered no trace of him and was beginning to\n",
      "conjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the\n",
      "execution of his menaces when suddenly I heard a shrill and dreadful\n",
      "scream. It came from the room into which Elizabeth had retired. As I\n",
      "heard it, the whole truth rushed into my mind, my arms dropped, the\n",
      "motion of every muscle and fibre was suspended; I could feel the blood\n",
      "trickling in my veins and tingling in the extremities of my limbs. This\n",

      "\n",
      "Great God! Why did I not then expire! Why am I here to relate the\n",
      "destruction of the best hope and the purest creature on earth? She was\n",
      "there, lifeless and inanimate, thrown across the bed, her head hanging down\n",
      "and her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair. Everywhere I\n",
      "turn I see the same figure—her bloodless arms and relaxed form flung\n",
      "by the murderer on its bridal bier. Could I behold this and live? Alas!\n",
      "Life is obstinate and clings closest where it is most hated. For a moment\n",
      "only did I lose recollection; I fell senseless on the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I recovered I found myself surrounded by the people of the inn; their\n",
      "countenances expressed a breathless terror, but the horror of others\n",
      "appeared only as a mockery, a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me. I\n",
      "escaped from them to the room where lay the body of Elizabeth, my love, my\n",
      "wife, so lately living, so dear, so worthy. She had been moved from the\n",

      "The shutters had been thrown back, and with a sensation of horror not to be\n",
      "described, I saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred.\n",
      "A grin was on the face of the monster; he seemed to jeer, as with his\n",

      "I attempted to accompany them and proceeded a short distance from the\n",
      "house, but my head whirled round, my steps were like those of a drunken\n",
      "man, I fell at last in a state of utter exhaustion; a film covered my\n",
      "eyes, and my skin was parched with the heat of fever. In this state I\n",
      "was carried back and placed on a bed, hardly conscious of what had\n",

      "I had lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "After an interval I arose, and as if by instinct, crawled into the room\n",
      "where the corpse of my beloved lay. There were women weeping around; I\n",
      "hung over it and joined my sad tears to theirs; all this time no\n",
      "distinct idea presented itself to my mind, but my thoughts rambled to\n",
      "various subjects, reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their\n",
      "cause. I was bewildered, in a cloud of wonder and horror. The death\n",
      "of William, the execution of Justine, the murder of Clerval, and lastly\n",
      "of my wife; even at that moment I knew not that my only remaining\n",
      "friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even now\n",
      "might be writhing under his grasp, and Ernest might be dead at his\n",
      "feet. This idea made me shudder and recalled me to action. I started\n",
      "up and resolved to return to Geneva with all possible speed.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were no horses to be procured, and I must return by the lake; but the\n",
      "wind was unfavourable, and the rain fell in torrents. However, it was\n",
      "hardly morning, and I might reasonably hope to arrive by night. I hired men\n",
      "to row and took an oar myself, for I had always experienced relief from\n",
      "mental torment in bodily exercise. But the overflowing misery I now felt,\n",
      "and the excess of agitation that I endured rendered me incapable of any\n",
      "exertion. I threw down the oar, and leaning my head upon my hands, gave way\n",
      "to every gloomy idea that arose. If I looked up, I saw scenes which were\n",
      "familiar to me in my happier time and which I had contemplated but the day\n",
      "before in the company of her who was now but a shadow and a recollection.\n",

      "then been observed by Elizabeth. Nothing is so painful to the human mind as\n",
      "a great and sudden change. The sun might shine or the clouds might lower,\n",

      "man.\n",
      "\n",
      "But why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed this last\n",
      "overwhelming event? Mine has been a tale of horrors; I have reached their\n",
      "_acme_, and what I must now relate can but be tedious to you. Know\n",
      "that, one by one, my friends were snatched away; I was left desolate. My\n",
      "own strength is exhausted, and I must tell, in a few words, what remains of\n",
      "my hideous narration.\n",
      "\n",
      "I arrived at Geneva. My father and Ernest yet lived, but the former sunk\n",
      "under the tidings that I bore. I see him now, excellent and venerable old\n",
      "man! His eyes wandered in vacancy, for they had lost their charm and their\n",
      "delight—his Elizabeth, his more than daughter, whom he doted on with\n",
      "all that affection which a man feels, who in the decline of life, having\n",
      "few affections, clings more earnestly to those that remain. Cursed, cursed\n",
      "be the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs and doomed him to waste\n",
      "in wretchedness! He could not live under the horrors that were accumulated\n",

      "\n",
      "What then became of me? I know not; I lost sensation, and chains and\n",
      "darkness were the only objects that pressed upon me. Sometimes,\n",
      "indeed, I dreamt that I wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales\n",
      "with the friends of my youth, but I awoke and found myself in a\n",
      "dungeon. Melancholy followed, but by degrees I gained a clear\n",
      "conception of my miseries and situation and was then released from my\n",
      "prison. For they had called me mad, and during many months, as I\n",
      "understood, a solitary cell had been my habitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Liberty, however, had been a useless gift to me, had I not, as I\n",
      "awakened to reason, at the same time awakened to revenge. As the\n",
      "memory of past misfortunes pressed upon me, I began to reflect on their\n",
      "cause—the monster whom I had created, the miserable dæmon whom I had\n",
      "sent abroad into the world for my destruction. I was possessed by a\n",
      "maddening rage when I thought of him, and desired and ardently prayed\n",
      "that I might have him within my grasp to wreak a great and signal\n",
      "revenge on his cursed head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began to\n",
      "reflect on the best means of securing him; and for this purpose, about\n",
      "a month after my release, I repaired to a criminal judge in the town\n",
      "and told him that I had an accusation to make, that I knew the\n",
      "destroyer of my family, and that I required him to exert his whole\n",

      "“I thank you,” replied I; “listen, therefore, to the\n",
      "deposition that I have to make. It is indeed a tale so strange that I\n",
      "should fear you would not credit it were there not something in truth\n",
      "which, however wonderful, forces conviction. The story is too connected to\n",
      "be mistaken for a dream, and I have no motive for falsehood.” My\n",
      "manner as I thus addressed him was impressive but calm; I had formed in my\n",
      "own heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death, and this purpose\n",
      "quieted my agony and for an interval reconciled me to life. I now related\n",
      "my history briefly but with firmness and precision, marking the dates with\n",
      "accuracy and never deviating into invective or exclamation.\n",

      "to act officially in consequence, the whole tide of his incredulity\n",
      "returned. He, however, answered mildly, “I would willingly afford you\n",
      "every aid in your pursuit, but the creature of whom you speak appears to\n",

      "it is in my power to seize the monster, be assured that he shall suffer\n",
      "punishment proportionate to his crimes. But I fear, from what you have\n",

      "impracticable; and thus, while every proper measure is pursued, you should\n",
      "make up your mind to disappointment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That cannot be; but all that I can say will be of little avail. My\n",
      "revenge is of no moment to you; yet, while I allow it to be a vice, I\n",
      "confess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul. My rage\n",
      "is unspeakable when I reflect that the murderer, whom I have turned\n",
      "loose upon society, still exists. You refuse my just demand; I have\n",

      "what path I should pursue. As night approached I found myself at the\n",
      "entrance of the cemetery where William, Elizabeth, and my father\n",
      "reposed. I entered it and approached the tomb which marked their\n",

      "and kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed, “By the\n",
      "sacred earth on which I kneel, by the shades that wander near me, by the\n",
      "deep and eternal grief that I feel, I swear; and by thee, O Night, and the\n",
      "spirits that preside over thee, to pursue the dæmon who caused this misery,\n",

      "\n",
      "I was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish\n",

      "it, and I felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter.\n",
      "Surely in that moment I should have been possessed by frenzy and have\n",
      "destroyed my miserable existence but that my vow was heard and that I\n",

      "enter by night and hide himself in a vessel bound for the Black Sea. I\n",
      "took my passage in the same ship, but he escaped, I know not how.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still evaded me, I\n",

      "this horrid apparition, informed me of his path; sometimes he himself,\n",
      "who feared that if I lost all trace of him I should despair and die,\n",
      "left some mark to guide me. The snows descended on my head, and I saw\n",
      "the print of his huge step on the white plain. To you first entering\n",
      "on life, to whom care is new and agony unknown, how can you understand\n",
      "what I have felt and still feel? Cold, want, and fatigue were the\n",
      "least pains which I was destined to endure; I was cursed by some devil\n",
      "and carried about with me my eternal hell; yet still a spirit of good\n",
      "followed and directed my steps and when I most murmured would suddenly\n",
      "extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties. Sometimes,\n",
      "when nature, overcome by hunger, sank under the exhaustion, a repast\n",
      "was prepared for me in the desert that restored and inspirited me. The\n",
      "fare was, indeed, coarse, such as the peasants of the country ate, but\n",
      "I will not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that I had\n",
      "invoked to aid me. Often, when all was dry, the heavens cloudless, and\n",
      "I was parched by thirst, a slight cloud would bedim the sky, shed the\n",
      "few drops that revived me, and vanish.\n",
      "\n",
      "I followed, when I could, the courses of the rivers; but the dæmon\n",
      "generally avoided these, as it was here that the population of the\n",
      "country chiefly collected. In other places human beings were seldom\n",
      "seen, and I generally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my\n",
      "path. I had money with me and gained the friendship of the villagers\n",
      "by distributing it; or I brought with me some food that I had killed,\n",
      "which, after taking a small part, I always presented to those who had\n",
      "provided me with fire and utensils for cooking.\n",
      "\n",
      "My life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it was during\n",
      "sleep alone that I could taste joy. O blessed sleep! Often, when most\n",
      "miserable, I sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture. The\n",
      "spirits that guarded me had provided these moments, or rather hours, of\n",
      "happiness that I might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage. Deprived of\n",
      "this respite, I should have sunk under my hardships. During the day I was\n",
      "sustained and inspirited by the hope of night, for in sleep I saw my\n",
      "friends, my wife, and my beloved country; again I saw the benevolent\n",
      "countenance of my father, heard the silver tones of my Elizabeth’s\n",
      "voice, and beheld Clerval enjoying health and youth. Often, when wearied by\n",
      "a toilsome march, I persuaded myself that I was dreaming until night should\n",
      "come and that I should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest\n",
      "friends. What agonising fondness did I feel for them! How did I cling to\n",
      "their dear forms, as sometimes they haunted even my waking hours, and\n",
      "persuade myself that they still lived! At such moments vengeance, that\n",
      "burned within me, died in my heart, and I pursued my path towards the\n",
      "destruction of the dæmon more as a task enjoined by heaven, as the\n",
      "mechanical impulse of some power of which I was unconscious, than as the\n",

      "What his feelings were whom I pursued I cannot know. Sometimes, indeed, he\n",

      "seize the animals whom starvation had forced from their hiding-places to\n",

      "upon a journey where your sufferings will satisfy my everlasting\n",
      "hatred.”\n",

      "My courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words; I\n",
      "resolved not to fail in my purpose, and calling on Heaven to support\n",
      "me, I continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts,\n",
      "until the ocean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary\n",
      "of the horizon. Oh! How unlike it was to the blue seasons of the\n",
      "south! Covered with ice, it was only to be distinguished from land by\n",
      "its superior wildness and ruggedness. The Greeks wept for joy when\n",

      "I hoped to intercept him before he should reach the beach. With new\n",
      "courage, therefore, I pressed on, and in two days arrived at a wretched\n",

      "her prey, and I should soon have sunk beneath this misery. Once, after\n",
      "the poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil gained the\n",

      "tremendous and overwhelming sound. The work was soon finished; in a few\n",
      "minutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy, and I was left\n",

      "presently he called to me in a feeble voice, and bidding me come near,\n",
      "said, “Alas! The strength I relied on is gone; I feel that I shall\n",
      "soon die, and he, my enemy and persecutor, may still be in being. Think\n",
      "not, Walton, that in the last moments of my existence I feel that burning\n",
      "hatred and ardent desire of revenge I once expressed; but I feel myself\n",
      "justified in desiring the death of my adversary. During these last days I\n",
      "have been occupied in examining my past conduct; nor do I find it blamable.\n",
      "In a fit of enthusiastic madness I created a rational creature and was\n",
      "bound towards him to assure, as far as was in my power, his happiness and\n",
      "well-being. This was my duty, but there was another still paramount to\n",
      "that. My duties towards the beings of my own species had greater claims to\n",
      "my attention because they included a greater proportion of happiness or\n",
      "misery. Urged by this view, I refused, and I did right in refusing, to\n",
      "create a companion for the first creature. He showed unparalleled malignity\n",
      "and selfishness in evil; he destroyed my friends; he devoted to destruction\n",
      "beings who possessed exquisite sensations, happiness, and wisdom; nor do I\n",
      "know where this thirst for vengeance may end. Miserable himself that he may\n",
      "render no other wretched, he ought to die. The task of his destruction was\n",
      "mine, but I have failed. When actuated by selfish and vicious motives, I\n",
      "asked you to undertake my unfinished work, and I renew this request now,\n",
      "when I am only induced by reason and virtue.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yet I cannot ask you to renounce your country and friends to fulfil\n",
      "this task; and now that you are returning to England, you will have\n",
      "little chance of meeting with him. But the consideration of these\n",
      "points, and the well balancing of what you may esteem your duties, I\n",
      "leave to you; my judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the near\n",
      "approach of death. I dare not ask you to do what I think right, for I\n",
      "may still be misled by passion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me; in\n",
      "other respects, this hour, when I momentarily expect my release, is the\n",
      "only happy one which I have enjoyed for several years. The forms of\n",
      "the beloved dead flit before me, and I hasten to their arms. Farewell,\n",
      "Walton! Seek happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition, even if it\n",
      "be only the apparently innocent one of distinguishing yourself in\n",
      "science and discoveries. Yet why do I say this? I have myself been\n",

      "effort, he sank into silence. About half an hour afterwards he\n",
      "attempted again to speak but was unable; he pressed my hand feebly, and\n",
      "his eyes closed for ever, while the irradiation of a gentle smile passed\n",
      "away from his lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "Margaret, what comment can I make on the untimely extinction of this\n",
      "glorious spirit? What can I say that will enable you to understand the\n",
      "depth of my sorrow? All that I should express would be inadequate and\n",
      "feeble. My tears flow; my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of\n",
      "disappointment. But I journey towards England, and I may there find\n",
      "consolation.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am interrupted. What do these sounds portend? It is midnight; the\n",
      "breeze blows fairly, and the watch on deck scarcely stir. Again there\n",
      "is a sound as of a human voice, but hoarser; it comes from the cabin\n",
      "where the remains of Frankenstein still lie. I must arise and examine.\n",
      "Good night, my sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great God! what a scene has just taken place! I am yet dizzy with the\n",
      "remembrance of it. I hardly know whether I shall have the power to detail\n",
      "it; yet the tale which I have recorded would be incomplete without this\n",
      "final and wonderful catastrophe.\n",
      "\n",
      "I entered the cabin where lay the remains of my ill-fated and admirable\n",
      "friend. Over him hung a form which I cannot find words to\n",
      "describe—gigantic in stature, yet uncouth and distorted in its\n",
      "proportions. As he hung over the coffin, his face was concealed by long\n",
      "locks of ragged hair; but one vast hand was extended, in colour and\n",
      "apparent texture like that of a mummy. When he heard the sound of my\n",
      "approach, he ceased to utter exclamations of grief and horror and sprung\n",
      "towards the window. Never did I behold a vision so horrible as his face, of\n",
      "such loathsome yet appalling hideousness. I shut my eyes involuntarily and\n",
      "endeavoured to recollect what were my duties with regard to this destroyer.\n",
      "I called on him to stay.\n",
      "\n",
      "He paused, looking on me with wonder, and again turning towards the\n",
      "lifeless form of his creator, he seemed to forget my presence, and\n",
      "every feature and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some\n",
      "uncontrollable passion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is also my victim!” he exclaimed. “In his murder my\n",
      "crimes are consummated; the miserable series of my being is wound to its\n",
      "close! Oh, Frankenstein! Generous and self-devoted being! What does it\n",
      "avail that I now ask thee to pardon me? I, who irretrievably destroyed thee\n",
      "by destroying all thou lovedst. Alas! He is cold, he cannot answer\n",
      "me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "His voice seemed suffocated, and my first impulses, which had suggested to\n",
      "me the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend in destroying his\n",
      "enemy, were now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion. I\n",
      "approached this tremendous being; I dared not again raise my eyes to his\n",
      "face, there was something so scaring and unearthly in his ugliness. I\n",
      "attempted to speak, but the words died away on my lips. The monster\n",
      "continued to utter wild and incoherent self-reproaches. At length I\n",
      "gathered resolution to address him in a pause of the tempest of his passion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your repentance,” I said, “is now superfluous. If you\n",
      "had listened to the voice of conscience and heeded the stings of remorse\n",
      "before you had urged your diabolical vengeance to this extremity,\n",
      "Frankenstein would yet have lived.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And do you dream?” said the dæmon. “Do you think that I was then\n",
      "dead to agony and remorse? He,” he continued, pointing to the corpse,\n",
      "“he suffered not in the consummation of the deed. Oh! Not the\n",
      "ten-thousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the\n",
      "lingering detail of its execution. A frightful selfishness hurried me\n",
      "on, while my heart was poisoned with remorse. Think you that the\n",
      "groans of Clerval were music to my ears? My heart was fashioned to be\n",
      "susceptible of love and sympathy, and when wrenched by misery to vice\n",
      "and hatred, it did not endure the violence of the change without\n",
      "torture such as you cannot even imagine.\n",
      "\n",
      "“After the murder of Clerval I returned to Switzerland, heart-broken\n",
      "and overcome. I pitied Frankenstein; my pity amounted to horror; I\n",
      "abhorred myself. But when I discovered that he, the author at once of\n",
      "my existence and of its unspeakable torments, dared to hope for\n",
      "happiness, that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me\n",
      "he sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from the\n",
      "indulgence of which I was for ever barred, then impotent envy and bitter\n",
      "indignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance. I\n",
      "recollected my threat and resolved that it should be accomplished. I\n",
      "knew that I was preparing for myself a deadly torture, but I was the\n",
      "slave, not the master, of an impulse which I detested yet could not\n",
      "disobey. Yet when she died! Nay, then I was not miserable. I had\n",
      "cast off all feeling, subdued all anguish, to riot in the excess of my\n",
      "despair. Evil thenceforth became my good. Urged thus far, I had no\n",
      "choice but to adapt my nature to an element which I had willingly\n",
      "chosen. The completion of my demoniacal design became an insatiable\n",
      "passion. And now it is ended; there is my last victim!”\n",
      "\n",
      "I was at first touched by the expressions of his misery; yet, when I called\n",
      "to mind what Frankenstein had said of his powers of eloquence and\n",
      "persuasion, and when I again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my\n",
      "friend, indignation was rekindled within me. “Wretch!” I said.\n",
      "“It is well that you come here to whine over the desolation that you\n",
      "have made. You throw a torch into a pile of buildings, and when they are\n",
      "consumed, you sit among the ruins and lament the fall. Hypocritical fiend!\n",
      "If he whom you mourn still lived, still would he be the object, again would\n",
      "he become the prey, of your accursed vengeance. It is not pity that you\n",
      "feel; you lament only because the victim of your malignity is withdrawn\n",
      "from your power.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, it is not thus—not thus,” interrupted the being.\n",
      "“Yet such must be the impression conveyed to you by what appears to\n",
      "be the purport of my actions. Yet I seek not a fellow feeling in my misery.\n",
      "No sympathy may I ever find. When I first sought it, it was the love of\n",
      "virtue, the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole being\n",
      "overflowed, that I wished to be participated. But now that virtue has\n",
      "become to me a shadow, and that happiness and affection are turned into\n",
      "bitter and loathing despair, in what should I seek for sympathy? I am\n",
      "content to suffer alone while my sufferings shall endure; when I die, I am\n",
      "well satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory. Once\n",
      "my fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment. Once\n",
      "I falsely hoped to meet with beings who, pardoning my outward form, would\n",
      "love me for the excellent qualities which I was capable of unfolding. I was\n",
      "nourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion. But now crime has\n",
      "degraded me beneath the meanest animal. No guilt, no mischief, no\n",
      "malignity, no misery, can be found comparable to mine. When I run over the\n",
      "frightful catalogue of my sins, I cannot believe that I am the same\n",
      "creature whose thoughts were once filled with sublime and transcendent\n",
      "visions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness. But it is even so; the\n",
      "fallen angel becomes a malignant devil. Yet even that enemy of God and man\n",
      "had friends and associates in his desolation; I am alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You, who call Frankenstein your friend, seem to have a knowledge of my\n",
      "crimes and his misfortunes. But in the detail which he gave you of them\n",
      "he could not sum up the hours and months of misery which I endured\n",
      "wasting in impotent passions. For while I destroyed his hopes, I did\n",
      "not satisfy my own desires. They were for ever ardent and craving; still\n",
      "I desired love and fellowship, and I was still spurned. Was there no\n",
      "injustice in this? Am I to be thought the only criminal, when all\n",
      "humankind sinned against me? Why do you not hate Felix, who drove his\n",
      "friend from his door with contumely? Why do you not execrate the rustic\n",
      "who sought to destroy the saviour of his child? Nay, these are virtuous\n",
      "and immaculate beings! I, the miserable and the abandoned, am an\n",
      "abortion, to be spurned at, and kicked, and trampled on. Even now my\n",
      "blood boils at the recollection of this injustice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But it is true that I am a wretch. I have murdered the lovely and\n",
      "the helpless; I have strangled the innocent as they slept and grasped to\n",
      "death his throat who never injured me or any other living thing. I have\n",
      "devoted my creator, the select specimen of all that is worthy of love and\n",
      "admiration among men, to misery; I have pursued him even to that\n",
      "irremediable ruin. There he lies, white and cold in death. You hate me, but\n",
      "your abhorrence cannot equal that with which I regard myself. I look on the\n",
      "hands which executed the deed; I think on the heart in which the\n",
      "imagination of it was conceived and long for the moment when these hands\n",
      "will meet my eyes, when that imagination will haunt my thoughts no more.\n",
      "\n",

      "is nearly complete. Neither yours nor any man’s death is needed to\n",
      "consummate the series of my being and accomplish that which must be done,\n",
      "but it requires my own. Do not think that I shall be slow to perform this\n",
      "sacrifice. I shall quit your vessel on the ice raft which brought me\n",

      "unquenched. He is dead who called me into being; and when I shall be no\n",
      "more, the very remembrance of us both will speedily vanish. I shall no\n",
      "longer see the sun or stars or feel the winds play on my cheeks. Light,\n",

      "rustling of the leaves and the warbling of the birds, and these were all to\n",

      "satiated in my life than in my destruction. But it was not so; thou\n",

      "and feel, thou wouldst not desire against me a vengeance greater than\n",
      "that which I feel. Blasted as thou wert, my agony was still superior to\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the\n",
      "bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into\n",
      "the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or\n",
      "conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice\n",
      "“without pictures or conversations?”\n",
      "\n",
      "So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the\n",
      "hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of\n",
      "making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and\n",
      "picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran\n",
      "close by her.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it\n",
      "so _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh\n",
      "dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards,\n",
      "it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the\n",
      "time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a\n",
      "watch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried\n",
      "on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she\n",
      "had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a\n",
      "watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\n",
      "field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a\n",
      "large rabbit-hole under the hedge.\n",
      "\n",
      "In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\n",
      "in the world she was to get out again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\n",
      "dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\n",
      "about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very\n",
      "deep well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\n",
      "plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what\n",
      "was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out\n",
      "what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she\n",
      "looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\n",
      "cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures\n",
      "hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she\n",
      "passed; it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to her great\n",
      "disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear\n",
      "of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the\n",
      "cupboards as she fell past it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall\n",
      "think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me\n",
      "at home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the\n",
      "top of the house!” (Which was very likely true.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Down, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end? “I wonder how\n",
      "many miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I must be\n",
      "getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would\n",
      "be four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learnt\n",
      "several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and\n",
      "though this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her\n",
      "knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good\n",
      "practice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about the right distance—but\n",
      "then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?” (Alice had no\n",
      "idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice\n",
      "grand words to say.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right _through_\n",
      "the earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk\n",

      "sometimes, “Do bats eat cats?” for, you see, as she couldn’t answer\n",

      "that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was\n",
      "walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,\n",
      "“Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?” when suddenly,\n",
      "thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and\n",
      "the fall was over.\n",

      "and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, “Oh my ears\n",
      "and whiskers, how late it’s getting!” She was close behind it when she\n",
      "turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found\n",
      "herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging\n",
      "from the roof.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when\n",
      "Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every\n",

      "get out again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid\n",
      "glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s\n",
      "first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;\n",
      "but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,\n",
      "but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second\n",
      "time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and\n",
      "behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the\n",
      "little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not\n",
      "much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the\n",
      "passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get\n",
      "out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright\n",
      "flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head\n",
      "through the doorway; “and even if my head would go through,” thought\n",
      "poor Alice, “it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh,\n",
      "how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only\n",
      "knew how to begin.” For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had\n",

      "indeed were really impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went\n",
      "back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at\n",
      "any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this\n",
      "time she found a little bottle on it, (“which certainly was not here\n",
      "before,” said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper\n",

      "\n",
      "As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment,\n",

      "she had somehow fallen into the sea, “and in that case I can go back by\n",
      "railway,” she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in\n",
      "her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go\n",
      "to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the\n",
      "sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row\n",
      "of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she\n",
      "soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when\n",
      "she was nine feet high.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wish I hadn’t cried so much!” said Alice, as she swam about, trying\n",

      "being drowned in my own tears! That _will_ be a queer thing, to be\n",
      "sure! However, everything is queer to-day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way\n",
      "off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought\n",
      "it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small\n",
      "she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had\n",
      "slipped in like herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Would it be of any use, now,” thought Alice, “to speak to this mouse?\n",
      "Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very\n",
      "likely it can talk: at any rate, there’s no harm in trying.” So she\n",
      "began: “O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired\n",
      "of swimming about here, O Mouse!” (Alice thought this must be the right\n",
      "way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but\n",
      "she remembered having seen in her brother’s Latin Grammar, “A mouse—of\n",
      "a mouse—to a mouse—a mouse—O mouse!”) The Mouse looked at her rather\n",
      "inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,\n",
      "but it said nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perhaps it doesn’t understand English,” thought Alice; “I daresay it’s\n",
      "a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.” (For, with all\n",
      "her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago\n",
      "anything had happened.) So she began again: “Où est ma chatte?” which\n",
      "was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a\n",
      "sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with\n",
      "fright. “Oh, I beg your pardon!” cried Alice hastily, afraid that she\n",
      "had hurt the poor animal’s feelings. “I quite forgot you didn’t like\n",
      "cats.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not like cats!” cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. “Would\n",
      "_you_ like cats if you were me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, perhaps not,” said Alice in a soothing tone: “don’t be angry\n",
      "about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you’d\n",
      "take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear\n",
      "quiet thing,” Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about\n",
      "in the pool, “and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her\n",
      "paws and washing her face—and she is such a nice soft thing to\n",
      "nurse—and she’s such a capital one for catching mice—oh, I beg your\n",
      "pardon!” cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all\n",
      "over, and she felt certain it must be really offended. “We won’t talk\n",
      "about her any more if you’d rather not.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We indeed!” cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his\n",
      "tail. “As if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always\n",
      "_hated_ cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don’t let me hear the name\n",
      "again!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I won’t indeed!” said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of\n",
      "conversation. “Are you—are you fond—of—of dogs?” The Mouse did not\n",
      "answer, so Alice went on eagerly: “There is such a nice little dog near\n",
      "our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you\n",
      "know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it’ll fetch things when\n",
      "you throw them, and it’ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts\n",

      "“I’m afraid I’ve offended it again!” For the Mouse was swimming away\n",
      "from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the\n",
      "pool as it went.\n",
      "\n",
      "So she called softly after it, “Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we\n",
      "won’t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don’t like them!” When the\n",
      "Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face\n",
      "was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low\n",
      "trembling voice, “Let us get to the shore, and then I’ll tell you my\n",
      "history, and you’ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the\n",
      "birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a\n",
      "Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice\n",
      "led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.\n",

      "A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank—the\n",
      "birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close\n",
      "to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a\n",
      "consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite\n",
      "natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if\n",
      "she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument\n",
      "with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, “I am\n",
      "older than you, and must know better;” and this Alice would not allow\n",
      "without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to\n",
      "tell its age, there was no more to be said.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,\n",
      "called out, “Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! _I’ll_ soon make\n",
      "you dry enough!” They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the\n",
      "Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she\n",
      "felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ahem!” said the Mouse with an important air, “are you all ready? This\n",
      "is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! ‘William\n",
      "the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted\n",
      "to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much\n",
      "accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of\n",
      "Mercia and Northumbria—’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ugh!” said the Lory, with a shiver.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I beg your pardon!” said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: “Did\n",
      "you speak?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not I!” said the Lory hastily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thought you did,” said the Mouse. “—I proceed. ‘Edwin and Morcar,\n",
      "the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even\n",
      "Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable—’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Found _what_?” said the Duck.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Found _it_,” the Mouse replied rather crossly: “of course you know\n",
      "what ‘it’ means.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know what ‘it’ means well enough, when _I_ find a thing,” said the\n",
      "Duck: “it’s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the\n",
      "archbishop find?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, “‘—found\n",
      "it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him\n",
      "the crown. William’s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence\n",
      "of his Normans—’ How are you getting on now, my dear?” it continued,\n",
      "turning to Alice as it spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As wet as ever,” said Alice in a melancholy tone: “it doesn’t seem to\n",
      "dry me at all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In that case,” said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, “I move\n",
      "that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic\n",
      "remedies—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Speak English!” said the Eaglet. “I don’t know the meaning of half\n",
      "those long words, and, what’s more, I don’t believe you do either!” And\n",
      "the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds\n",
      "tittered audibly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What I was going to say,” said the Dodo in an offended tone, “was,\n",
      "that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What _is_ a Caucus-race?” said Alice; not that she wanted much to\n",
      "know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that _somebody_ ought to\n",
      "speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why,” said the Dodo, “the best way to explain it is to do it.” (And,\n",
      "as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will\n",
      "tell you how the Dodo managed it.)\n",
      "\n",
      "First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (“the exact\n",
      "shape doesn’t matter,” it said,) and then all the party were placed\n",
      "along the course, here and there. There was no “One, two, three, and\n",
      "away,” but they began running when they liked, and left off when they\n",
      "liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,\n",
      "when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry\n",
      "again, the Dodo suddenly called out “The race is over!” and they all\n",
      "crowded round it, panting, and asking, “But who has won?”\n",
      "\n",
      "This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of\n",
      "thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its\n",
      "forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the\n",
      "pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo\n",
      "said, “_Everybody_ has won, and all must have prizes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But who is to give the prizes?” quite a chorus of voices asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, _she_, of course,” said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one\n",
      "finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a\n",
      "confused way, “Prizes! Prizes!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her\n",
      "pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had\n",
      "not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly\n",
      "one a-piece, all round.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But she must have a prize herself, you know,” said the Mouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course,” the Dodo replied very gravely. “What else have you got in\n",
      "your pocket?” he went on, turning to Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Only a thimble,” said Alice sadly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hand it over here,” said the Dodo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly\n",
      "presented the thimble, saying “We beg your acceptance of this elegant\n",
      "thimble;” and, when it had finished this short speech, they all\n",
      "cheered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave\n",
      "that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything\n",
      "to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as\n",
      "she could.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and\n",
      "confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste\n",
      "theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.\n",
      "However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and\n",
      "begged the Mouse to tell them something more.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You promised to tell me your history, you know,” said Alice, “and why\n",
      "it is you hate—C and D,” she added in a whisper, half afraid that it\n",
      "would be offended again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mine is a long and a sad tale!” said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and\n",
      "sighing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It _is_ a long tail, certainly,” said Alice, looking down with wonder\n",
      "at the Mouse’s tail; “but why do you call it sad?” And she kept on\n",
      "puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the\n",
      "tale was something like this:—\n",
      "\n",
      "         “Fury said to a mouse, That he met in the house, ‘Let us both\n",
      "         go to law: _I_ will prosecute _you_.—Come, I’ll take no\n",
      "         denial; We must have a trial: For really this morning I’ve\n",
      "         nothing to do.’ Said the mouse to the cur, ‘Such a trial, dear\n",
      "         sir, With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath.’\n",
      "         ‘I’ll be judge, I’ll be jury,’ Said cunning old Fury: ‘I’ll\n",
      "         try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are not attending!” said the Mouse to Alice severely. “What are\n",
      "you thinking of?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I beg your pardon,” said Alice very humbly: “you had got to the fifth\n",
      "bend, I think?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I had _not!_” cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A knot!” said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking\n",
      "anxiously about her. “Oh, do let me help to undo it!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shall do nothing of the sort,” said the Mouse, getting up and\n",
      "walking away. “You insult me by talking such nonsense!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I didn’t mean it!” pleaded poor Alice. “But you’re so easily offended,\n",
      "you know!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Mouse only growled in reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Please come back and finish your story!” Alice called after it; and\n",
      "the others all joined in chorus, “Yes, please do!” but the Mouse only\n",
      "shook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What a pity it wouldn’t stay!” sighed the Lory, as soon as it was\n",
      "quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to\n",
      "her daughter “Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose\n",
      "_your_ temper!” “Hold your tongue, Ma!” said the young Crab, a little\n",
      "snappishly. “You’re enough to try the patience of an oyster!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!” said Alice aloud,\n",
      "addressing nobody in particular. “She’d soon fetch it back!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?” said the\n",
      "Lory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:\n",
      "“Dinah’s our cat. And she’s such a capital one for catching mice you\n",
      "can’t think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,\n",
      "she’ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!”\n",
      "\n",
      "This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the\n",
      "birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very\n",
      "carefully, remarking, “I really must be getting home; the night-air\n",
      "doesn’t suit my throat!” and a Canary called out in a trembling voice\n",
      "to its children, “Come away, my dears! It’s high time you were all in\n",
      "bed!” On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left\n",
      "alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wish I hadn’t mentioned Dinah!” she said to herself in a melancholy\n",
      "tone. “Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I’m sure she’s the best\n",
      "cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you\n",
      "any more!” And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very\n",
      "lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a\n",
      "little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up\n",
      "eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was\n",
      "coming back to finish his story.\n",

      "The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking\n",
      "anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard\n",
      "it muttering to itself “The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh\n",
      "my fur and whiskers! She’ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are\n",
      "ferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?” Alice guessed in a\n",
      "moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid\n",
      "gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but\n",
      "they were nowhere to be seen—everything seemed to have changed since\n",
      "her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the\n",
      "little door, had vanished completely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and\n",
      "called out to her in an angry tone, “Why, Mary Ann, what _are_ you\n",
      "doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and\n",
      "a fan! Quick, now!” And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off\n",
      "at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the\n",
      "mistake it had made.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He took me for his housemaid,” she said to herself as she ran. “How\n",
      "surprised he’ll be when he finds out who I am! But I’d better take him\n",
      "his fan and gloves—that is, if I can find them.” As she said this, she\n",
      "came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass\n",
      "plate with the name “W. RABBIT,” engraved upon it. She went in without\n",
      "knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the\n",
      "real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the\n",
      "fan and gloves.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How queer it seems,” Alice said to herself, “to be going messages for\n",
      "a rabbit! I suppose Dinah’ll be sending me on messages next!” And she\n",
      "began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: “‘Miss Alice! Come\n",
      "here directly, and get ready for your walk!’ ‘Coming in a minute,\n",
      "nurse! But I’ve got to see that the mouse doesn’t get out.’ Only I\n",
      "don’t think,” Alice went on, “that they’d let Dinah stop in the house\n",
      "if it began ordering people about like that!”\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table\n",
      "in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three\n",
      "pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the\n",
      "gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a\n",
      "little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label\n",
      "this time with the words “DRINK ME,” but nevertheless she uncorked it\n",
      "and put it to her lips. “I know _something_ interesting is sure to\n",
      "happen,” she said to herself, “whenever I eat or drink anything; so\n",
      "I’ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it’ll make me grow large\n",
      "again, for really I’m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!”\n",
      "\n",
      "It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had\n",
      "drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,\n",
      "and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put\n",
      "down the bottle, saying to herself “That’s quite enough—I hope I shan’t\n",
      "grow any more—As it is, I can’t get out at the door—I do wish I hadn’t\n",
      "drunk quite so much!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,\n",
      "and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there\n",
      "was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with\n",
      "one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.\n",
      "Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out\n",
      "of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself “Now I\n",
      "can do no more, whatever happens. What _will_ become of me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,\n",
      "and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there\n",
      "seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room\n",
      "again, no wonder she felt unhappy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was much pleasanter at home,” thought poor Alice, “when one wasn’t\n",
      "always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and\n",
      "rabbits. I almost wish I hadn’t gone down that rabbit-hole—and yet—and\n",
      "yet—it’s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what\n",
      "_can_ have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied\n",
      "that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of\n",
      "one! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And\n",
      "when I grow up, I’ll write one—but I’m grown up now,” she added in a\n",
      "sorrowful tone; “at least there’s no room to grow up any more _here_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But then,” thought Alice, “shall I _never_ get any older than I am\n",
      "now? That’ll be a comfort, one way—never to be an old woman—but\n",
      "then—always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn’t like _that!_”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, you foolish Alice!” she answered herself. “How can you learn\n",
      "lessons in here? Why, there’s hardly room for _you_, and no room at all\n",
      "for any lesson-books!”\n",
      "\n",
      "And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and\n",
      "making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes\n",
      "she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mary Ann! Mary Ann!” said the voice. “Fetch me my gloves this moment!”\n",
      "Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was\n",
      "the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the\n",
      "house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as\n",
      "large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as\n",
      "the door opened inwards, and Alice’s elbow was pressed hard against it,\n",
      "that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself “Then I’ll\n",
      "go round and get in at the window.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_That_ you won’t!” thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied\n",
      "she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her\n",
      "hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,\n",
      "but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,\n",
      "from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a\n",
      "cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next came an angry voice—the Rabbit’s—“Pat! Pat! Where are you?” And\n",
      "then a voice she had never heard before, “Sure then I’m here! Digging\n",
      "for apples, yer honour!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Digging for apples, indeed!” said the Rabbit angrily. “Here! Come and\n",
      "help me out of _this!_” (Sounds of more broken glass.)\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now tell me, Pat, what’s that in the window?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure, it’s an arm, yer honour!” (He pronounced it “arrum.”)\n",
      "\n",
      "“An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole\n",
      "window!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure, it does, yer honour: but it’s an arm for all that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, it’s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers\n",
      "now and then; such as, “Sure, I don’t like it, yer honour, at all, at\n",
      "all!” “Do as I tell you, you coward!” and at last she spread out her\n",
      "hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were\n",
      "_two_ little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. “What a number\n",
      "of cucumber-frames there must be!” thought Alice. “I wonder what\n",
      "they’ll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they\n",
      "_could!_ I’m sure _I_ don’t want to stay in here any longer!”\n",
      "\n",
      "She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a\n",
      "rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all\n",
      "talking together: she made out the words: “Where’s the other\n",
      "ladder?—Why, I hadn’t to bring but one; Bill’s got the other—Bill!\n",
      "fetch it here, lad!—Here, put ’em up at this corner—No, tie ’em\n",
      "together first—they don’t reach half high enough yet—Oh! they’ll do\n",
      "well enough; don’t be particular—Here, Bill! catch hold of this\n",
      "rope—Will the roof bear?—Mind that loose slate—Oh, it’s coming down!\n",
      "Heads below!” (a loud crash)—“Now, who did that?—It was Bill, I\n",
      "fancy—Who’s to go down the chimney?—Nay, _I_ shan’t! _You_ do\n",
      "it!—_That_ I won’t, then!—Bill’s to go down—Here, Bill! the master says\n",
      "you’re to go down the chimney!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! So Bill’s got to come down the chimney, has he?” said Alice to\n",
      "herself. “Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn’t be in\n",
      "Bill’s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but\n",
      "I _think_ I can kick a little!”\n",
      "\n",
      "She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till\n",
      "she heard a little animal (she couldn’t guess of what sort it was)\n",
      "scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,\n",
      "saying to herself “This is Bill,” she gave one sharp kick, and waited\n",
      "to see what would happen next.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first thing she heard was a general chorus of “There goes Bill!”\n",
      "then the Rabbit’s voice along—“Catch him, you by the hedge!” then\n",
      "silence, and then another confusion of voices—“Hold up his head—Brandy\n",
      "now—Don’t choke him—How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell\n",
      "us all about it!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (“That’s Bill,” thought\n",
      "Alice,) “Well, I hardly know—No more, thank ye; I’m better now—but I’m\n",
      "a deal too flustered to tell you—all I know is, something comes at me\n",
      "like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So you did, old fellow!” said the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We must burn the house down!” said the Rabbit’s voice; and Alice\n",
      "called out as loud as she could, “If you do, I’ll set Dinah at you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, “I\n",
      "wonder what they _will_ do next! If they had any sense, they’d take the\n",
      "roof off.” After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and\n",
      "Alice heard the Rabbit say, “A barrowful will do, to begin with.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A barrowful of _what?_” thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,\n",
      "for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the\n",
      "window, and some of them hit her in the face. “I’ll put a stop to\n",
      "this,” she said to herself, and shouted out, “You’d better not do that\n",
      "again!” which produced another dead silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into\n",
      "little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her\n",
      "head. “If I eat one of these cakes,” she thought, “it’s sure to make\n",
      "_some_ change in my size; and as it can’t possibly make me larger, it\n",
      "must make me smaller, I suppose.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she\n",
      "began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get\n",
      "through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of\n",
      "little animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill,\n",
      "was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it\n",
      "something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she\n",
      "appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself\n",
      "safe in a thick wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The first thing I’ve got to do,” said Alice to herself, as she\n",
      "wandered about in the wood, “is to grow to my right size again; and the\n",
      "second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that\n",
      "will be the best plan.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply\n",
      "arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea\n",
      "how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among\n",
      "the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a\n",
      "great hurry.\n",
      "\n",
      "An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and\n",
      "feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. “Poor little\n",
      "thing!” said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to\n",
      "it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it\n",
      "might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in\n",
      "spite of all her coaxing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and\n",
      "held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off\n",
      "all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,\n",
      "and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,\n",
      "to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the\n",
      "other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head\n",
      "over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was\n",
      "very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every\n",
      "moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then\n",
      "the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very\n",
      "little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely\n",
      "all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with\n",
      "its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.\n",
      "\n",
      "This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she\n",
      "set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath,\n",
      "and till the puppy’s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And yet what a dear little puppy it was!” said Alice, as she leant\n",
      "against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the\n",
      "leaves: “I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if—if I’d\n",
      "only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I’d nearly forgotten that\n",
      "I’ve got to grow up again! Let me see—how _is_ it to be managed? I\n",
      "suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great\n",
      "question is, what?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at\n",
      "the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that\n",
      "looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.\n",
      "There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as\n",
      "herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and\n",
      "behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what\n",
      "was on the top of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the\n",
      "mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue\n",
      "caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly\n",
      "smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of\n",
      "anything else.\n",

      "CHAPTER V.\n",
      "Advice from a Caterpillar\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in\n",
      "silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and\n",
      "addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who are _you?_” said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,\n",
      "rather shyly, “I—I hardly know, sir, just at present—at least I know\n",
      "who I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been\n",
      "changed several times since then.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you mean by that?” said the Caterpillar sternly. “Explain\n",
      "yourself!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can’t explain _myself_, I’m afraid, sir,” said Alice, “because I’m\n",
      "not myself, you see.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t see,” said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m afraid I can’t put it more clearly,” Alice replied very politely,\n",
      "“for I can’t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many\n",
      "different sizes in a day is very confusing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It isn’t,” said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, perhaps you haven’t found it so yet,” said Alice; “but when you\n",
      "have to turn into a chrysalis—you will some day, you know—and then\n",
      "after that into a butterfly, I should think you’ll feel it a little\n",
      "queer, won’t you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not a bit,” said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,” said Alice; “all I know\n",
      "is, it would feel very queer to _me_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You!” said the Caterpillar contemptuously. “Who are _you?_”\n",
      "\n",
      "Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.\n",
      "Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar’s making such _very_\n",
      "short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, “I\n",
      "think, you ought to tell me who _you_ are, first.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why?” said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any\n",
      "good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant\n",
      "state of mind, she turned away.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come back!” the Caterpillar called after her. “I’ve something\n",
      "important to say!”\n",
      "\n",
      "This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Keep your temper,” said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is that all?” said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she\n",
      "could.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do,\n",
      "and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For\n",
      "some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded\n",
      "its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, “So you\n",
      "think you’re changed, do you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m afraid I am, sir,” said Alice; “I can’t remember things as I\n",
      "used—and I don’t keep the same size for ten minutes together!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Can’t remember _what_ things?” said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I’ve tried to say “How doth the little busy bee,” but it all\n",
      "came different!” Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Repeat, “_You are old, Father William_,’” said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice folded her hands, and began:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are old, Father William,” the young man said,\n",
      "    “And your hair has become very white;\n",
      "And yet you incessantly stand on your head—\n",
      "    Do you think, at your age, it is right?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In my youth,” Father William replied to his son,\n",
      "    “I feared it might injure the brain;\n",
      "But, now that I’m perfectly sure I have none,\n",
      "    Why, I do it again and again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are old,” said the youth, “as I mentioned before,\n",
      "    And have grown most uncommonly fat;\n",
      "Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door—\n",
      "    Pray, what is the reason of that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In my youth,” said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,\n",
      "    “I kept all my limbs very supple\n",
      "By the use of this ointment—one shilling the box—\n",
      "    Allow me to sell you a couple?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are old,” said the youth, “and your jaws are too weak\n",
      "    For anything tougher than suet;\n",
      "Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak—\n",
      "    Pray, how did you manage to do it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In my youth,” said his father, “I took to the law,\n",
      "    And argued each case with my wife;\n",
      "And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,\n",
      "    Has lasted the rest of my life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are old,” said the youth, “one would hardly suppose\n",
      "    That your eye was as steady as ever;\n",
      "Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose—\n",
      "    What made you so awfully clever?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have answered three questions, and that is enough,”\n",
      "    Said his father; “don’t give yourself airs!\n",
      "Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?\n",
      "    Be off, or I’ll kick you down stairs!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is not said right,” said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not _quite_ right, I’m afraid,” said Alice, timidly; “some of the\n",
      "words have got altered.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is wrong from beginning to end,” said the Caterpillar decidedly,\n",
      "and there was silence for some minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Caterpillar was the first to speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What size do you want to be?” it asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, I’m not particular as to size,” Alice hastily replied; “only one\n",
      "doesn’t like changing so often, you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I _don’t_ know,” said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life\n",
      "before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you content now?” said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I should like to be a _little_ larger, sir, if you wouldn’t\n",
      "mind,” said Alice: “three inches is such a wretched height to be.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is a very good height indeed!” said the Caterpillar angrily,\n",
      "rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I’m not used to it!” pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she\n",
      "thought of herself, “I wish the creatures wouldn’t be so easily\n",
      "offended!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’ll get used to it in time,” said the Caterpillar; and it put the\n",
      "hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.\n",
      "\n",
      "This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a\n",
      "minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and\n",
      "yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the\n",
      "mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,\n",
      "“One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you\n",
      "grow shorter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“One side of _what?_ The other side of _what?_” thought Alice to\n",
      "herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of the mushroom,” said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it\n",
      "aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute,\n",
      "trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was\n",
      "perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at\n",
      "last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke\n",
      "off a bit of the edge with each hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And now which is which?” she said to herself, and nibbled a little of\n",
      "the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a\n",
      "violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!\n",
      "\n",
      "She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt\n",
      "that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she\n",
      "set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed\n",
      "so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her\n",
      "mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the\n",
      "lefthand bit.\n",
      "\n",
      "*      *      *      *      *      *      *\n",
      "\n",
      "    *      *      *      *      *      *\n",
      "\n",
      "*      *      *      *      *      *      *\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come, my head’s free at last!” said Alice in a tone of delight, which\n",
      "changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders\n",
      "were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was\n",
      "an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a\n",
      "sea of green leaves that lay far below her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What _can_ all that green stuff be?” said Alice. “And where _have_ my\n",
      "shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can’t see you?”\n",
      "She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,\n",
      "except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.\n",
      "\n",
      "As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head,\n",
      "she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that\n",
      "her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She\n",
      "had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was\n",
      "going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but\n",
      "the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp\n",
      "hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her\n",
      "face, and was beating her violently with its wings.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Serpent!” screamed the Pigeon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m _not_ a serpent!” said Alice indignantly. “Let me alone!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Serpent, I say again!” repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued\n",
      "tone, and added with a kind of sob, “I’ve tried every way, and nothing\n",
      "seems to suit them!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I haven’t the least idea what you’re talking about,” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve tried the roots of trees, and I’ve tried banks, and I’ve tried\n",
      "hedges,” the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; “but those\n",
      "serpents! There’s no pleasing them!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in\n",
      "saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As if it wasn’t trouble enough hatching the eggs,” said the Pigeon;\n",
      "“but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I\n",
      "haven’t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m very sorry you’ve been annoyed,” said Alice, who was beginning to\n",
      "see its meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And just as I’d taken the highest tree in the wood,” continued the\n",
      "Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, “and just as I was thinking I\n",
      "should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down\n",
      "from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I’m _not_ a serpent, I tell you!” said Alice. “I’m a—I’m a—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well! _What_ are you?” said the Pigeon. “I can see you’re trying to\n",
      "invent something!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I—I’m a little girl,” said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered\n",
      "the number of changes she had gone through that day.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A likely story indeed!” said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest\n",
      "contempt. “I’ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never\n",
      "_one_ with such a neck as that! No, no! You’re a serpent; and there’s\n",
      "no use denying it. I suppose you’ll be telling me next that you never\n",
      "tasted an egg!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I _have_ tasted eggs, certainly,” said Alice, who was a very truthful\n",
      "child; “but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you\n",
      "know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t believe it,” said the Pigeon; “but if they do, why then\n",
      "they’re a kind of serpent, that’s all I can say.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a\n",
      "minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, “You’re\n",
      "looking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough; and what does it matter to\n",
      "me whether you’re a little girl or a serpent?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It matters a good deal to _me_,” said Alice hastily; “but I’m not\n",
      "looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn’t want\n",
      "_yours_: I don’t like them raw.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, be off, then!” said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled\n",
      "down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well\n",
      "as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches,\n",
      "and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while\n",
      "she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands,\n",
      "and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at\n",
      "the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until\n",
      "she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it\n",
      "felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,\n",
      "and began talking to herself, as usual. “Come, there’s half my plan\n",
      "done now! How puzzling all these changes are! I’m never sure what I’m\n",
      "going to be, from one minute to another! However, I’ve got back to my\n",
      "right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden—how\n",
      "_is_ that to be done, I wonder?” As she said this, she came suddenly\n",
      "upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.\n",
      "“Whoever lives there,” thought Alice, “it’ll never do to come upon them\n",
      "_this_ size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!” So she\n",
      "began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go\n",
      "near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.\n",

      "For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what\n",
      "to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the\n",
      "wood—(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:\n",
      "otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a\n",
      "fish)—and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by\n",
      "another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a\n",
      "frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled\n",
      "all over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all\n",
      "about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,\n",
      "nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,\n",
      "saying, in a solemn tone, “For the Duchess. An invitation from the\n",
      "Queen to play croquet.” The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn\n",
      "tone, only changing the order of the words a little, “From the Queen.\n",
      "An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood\n",
      "for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the\n",
      "Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the\n",
      "door, staring stupidly up into the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s no sort of use in knocking,” said the Footman, “and that for\n",
      "two reasons. First, because I’m on the same side of the door as you\n",
      "are; secondly, because they’re making such a noise inside, no one could\n",
      "possibly hear you.” And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary\n",
      "noise going on within—a constant howling and sneezing, and every now\n",
      "and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to\n",
      "pieces.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Please, then,” said Alice, “how am I to get in?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There might be some sense in your knocking,” the Footman went on\n",
      "without attending to her, “if we had the door between us. For instance,\n",
      "if you were _inside_, you might knock, and I could let you out, you\n",
      "know.” He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and\n",
      "this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. “But perhaps he can’t help it,”\n",
      "she said to herself; “his eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his\n",
      "head. But at any rate he might answer questions.—How am I to get in?”\n",
      "she repeated, aloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shall sit here,” the Footman remarked, “till tomorrow—”\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came\n",
      "skimming out, straight at the Footman’s head: it just grazed his nose,\n",
      "and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“—or next day, maybe,” the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly\n",
      "as if nothing had happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How am I to get in?” asked Alice again, in a louder tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "“_Are_ you to get in at all?” said the Footman. “That’s the first\n",
      "question, you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. “It’s really\n",
      "dreadful,” she muttered to herself, “the way all the creatures argue.\n",
      "It’s enough to drive one crazy!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his\n",
      "remark, with variations. “I shall sit here,” he said, “on and off, for\n",
      "days and days.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But what am _I_ to do?” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Anything you like,” said the Footman, and began whistling.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, there’s no use in talking to him,” said Alice desperately: “he’s\n",
      "perfectly idiotic!” And she opened the door and went in.\n",
      "\n",
      "The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from\n",
      "one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool\n",
      "in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire,\n",
      "stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s certainly too much pepper in that soup!” Alice said to\n",
      "herself, as well as she could for sneezing.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed\n",
      "occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling\n",
      "alternately without a moment’s pause. The only things in the kitchen\n",
      "that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting\n",
      "on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Please would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, for she was\n",
      "not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, “why\n",
      "your cat grins like that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s a Cheshire cat,” said the Duchess, “and that’s why. Pig!”\n",
      "\n",
      "She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite\n",
      "jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the\n",
      "baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“I didn’t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn’t\n",
      "know that cats _could_ grin.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They all can,” said the Duchess; “and most of ’em do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t know of any that do,” Alice said very politely, feeling quite\n",
      "pleased to have got into a conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You don’t know much,” said the Duchess; “and that’s a fact.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would\n",
      "be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she\n",
      "was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the\n",
      "fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at\n",
      "the Duchess and the baby—the fire-irons came first; then followed a\n",
      "shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of\n",
      "them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,\n",
      "that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, _please_ mind what you’re doing!” cried Alice, jumping up and down\n",
      "in an agony of terror. “Oh, there goes his _precious_ nose!” as an\n",
      "unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it\n",
      "off.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If everybody minded their own business,” the Duchess said in a hoarse\n",
      "growl, “the world would go round a deal faster than it does.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Which would _not_ be an advantage,” said Alice, who felt very glad to\n",
      "get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. “Just\n",
      "think of what work it would make with the day and night! You see the\n",
      "earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Talking of axes,” said the Duchess, “chop off her head!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take\n",
      "the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to\n",
      "be listening, so she went on again: “Twenty-four hours, I _think_; or\n",
      "is it twelve? I—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, don’t bother _me_,” said the Duchess; “I never could abide\n",
      "figures!” And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a\n",
      "sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at\n",
      "the end of every line:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Speak roughly to your little boy,\n",
      "    And beat him when he sneezes:\n",
      "He only does it to annoy,\n",
      "    Because he knows it teases.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CHORUS.\n",
      "(In which the cook and the baby joined):\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wow! wow! wow!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing\n",
      "the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,\n",
      "that Alice could hardly hear the words:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“I speak severely to my boy,\n",
      "    I beat him when he sneezes;\n",
      "For he can thoroughly enjoy\n",
      "    The pepper when he pleases!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CHORUS.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wow! wow! wow!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!” the Duchess said to Alice,\n",
      "flinging the baby at her as she spoke. “I must go and get ready to play\n",
      "croquet with the Queen,” and she hurried out of the room. The cook\n",
      "threw a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped\n",
      "little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions,\n",
      "“just like a star-fish,” thought Alice. The poor little thing was\n",
      "snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling\n",
      "itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for\n",
      "the first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to\n",
      "twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right\n",
      "ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it\n",
      "out into the open air. “If I don’t take this child away with me,”\n",
      "thought Alice, “they’re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn’t it be\n",
      "murder to leave it behind?” She said the last words out loud, and the\n",
      "little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).\n",
      "“Don’t grunt,” said Alice; “that’s not at all a proper way of\n",
      "expressing yourself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face\n",
      "to see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had\n",
      "a _very_ turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also\n",
      "its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did\n",
      "not like the look of the thing at all. “But perhaps it was only\n",
      "sobbing,” she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there\n",
      "were any tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "No, there were no tears. “If you’re going to turn into a pig, my dear,”\n",
      "said Alice, seriously, “I’ll have nothing more to do with you. Mind\n",
      "now!” The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible\n",
      "to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was just beginning to think to herself, “Now, what am I to do\n",
      "with this creature when I get it home?” when it grunted again, so\n",
      "violently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time\n",
      "there could be _no_ mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than\n",
      "a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it\n",
      "further.\n",
      "\n",
      "So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it\n",
      "trot away quietly into the wood. “If it had grown up,” she said to\n",
      "herself, “it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes\n",
      "rather a handsome pig, I think.” And she began thinking over other\n",
      "children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying\n",
      "to herself, “if one only knew the right way to change them—” when she\n",
      "was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of\n",
      "a tree a few yards off.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she\n",
      "thought: still it had _very_ long claws and a great many teeth, so she\n",
      "felt that it ought to be treated with respect.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Cheshire Puss,” she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know\n",
      "whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little\n",
      "wider. “Come, it’s pleased so far,” thought Alice, and she went on.\n",
      "“Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the Cat.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t much care where—” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,” said the Cat.\n",
      "\n",
      "“—so long as I get _somewhere_,” Alice added as an explanation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, you’re sure to do that,” said the Cat, “if you only walk long\n",
      "enough.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another\n",
      "question. “What sort of people live about here?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In _that_ direction,” the Cat said, waving its right paw round, “lives\n",
      "a Hatter: and in _that_ direction,” waving the other paw, “lives a\n",
      "March Hare. Visit either you like: they’re both mad.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I don’t want to go among mad people,” Alice remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, you can’t help that,” said the Cat: “we’re all mad here. I’m mad.\n",
      "You’re mad.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How do you know I’m mad?” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You must be,” said the Cat, “or you wouldn’t have come here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice didn’t think that proved it at all; however, she went on “And how\n",
      "do you know that you’re mad?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To begin with,” said the Cat, “a dog’s not mad. You grant that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I suppose so,” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, then,” the Cat went on, “you see, a dog growls when it’s angry,\n",
      "and wags its tail when it’s pleased. Now _I_ growl when I’m pleased,\n",
      "and wag my tail when I’m angry. Therefore I’m mad.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_I_ call it purring, not growling,” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Call it what you like,” said the Cat. “Do you play croquet with the\n",
      "Queen to-day?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should like it very much,” said Alice, “but I haven’t been invited\n",
      "yet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’ll see me there,” said the Cat, and vanished.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer\n",
      "things happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been,\n",
      "it suddenly appeared again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“By-the-bye, what became of the baby?” said the Cat. “I’d nearly\n",
      "forgotten to ask.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It turned into a pig,” Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back\n",
      "in a natural way.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thought it would,” said the Cat, and vanished again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not\n",
      "appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in\n",
      "which the March Hare was said to live. “I’ve seen hatters before,” she\n",
      "said to herself; “the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and\n",
      "perhaps as this is May it won’t be raving mad—at least not so mad as it\n",
      "was in March.” As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat\n",
      "again, sitting on a branch of a tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did you say pig, or fig?” said the Cat.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I said pig,” replied Alice; “and I wish you wouldn’t keep appearing\n",

      "\n",
      "“All right,” said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,\n",
      "beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which\n",
      "remained some time after the rest of it had gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well! I’ve often seen a cat without a grin,” thought Alice; “but a\n",
      "grin without a cat! It’s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!”\n",
      "\n",
      "She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of\n",
      "the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the\n",

      "was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had\n",
      "nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself\n",
      "to about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather\n",

      "cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. “Very\n",
      "uncomfortable for the Dormouse,” thought Alice; “only, as it’s asleep,\n",
      "I suppose it doesn’t mind.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at\n",
      "one corner of it: “No room! No room!” they cried out when they saw\n",
      "Alice coming. “There’s _plenty_ of room!” said Alice indignantly, and\n",
      "she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have some wine,” the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.\n",
      "“I don’t see any wine,” she remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There isn’t any,” said the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then it wasn’t very civil of you to offer it,” said Alice angrily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It wasn’t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,” said\n",
      "the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I didn’t know it was _your_ table,” said Alice; “it’s laid for a great\n",
      "many more than three.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your hair wants cutting,” said the Hatter. He had been looking at\n",
      "Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first\n",
      "speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You should learn not to make personal remarks,” Alice said with some\n",
      "severity; “it’s very rude.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he _said_\n",
      "was, “Why is a raven like a writing-desk?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come, we shall have some fun now!” thought Alice. “I’m glad they’ve\n",
      "begun asking riddles.—I believe I can guess that,” she added aloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?” said\n",
      "the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Exactly so,” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then you should say what you mean,” the March Hare went on.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do,” Alice hastily replied; “at least—at least I mean what I\n",
      "say—that’s the same thing, you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not the same thing a bit!” said the Hatter. “You might just as well\n",
      "say that ‘I see what I eat’ is the same thing as ‘I eat what I see’!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You might just as well say,” added the March Hare, “that ‘I like what\n",
      "I get’ is the same thing as ‘I get what I like’!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You might just as well say,” added the Dormouse, who seemed to be\n",
      "talking in his sleep, “that ‘I breathe when I sleep’ is the same thing\n",
      "as ‘I sleep when I breathe’!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It _is_ the same thing with you,” said the Hatter, and here the\n",
      "conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while\n",
      "Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and\n",
      "writing-desks, which wasn’t much.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hatter was the first to break the silence. “What day of the month\n",
      "is it?” he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his\n",
      "pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,\n",
      "and holding it to his ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice considered a little, and then said “The fourth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Two days wrong!” sighed the Hatter. “I told you butter wouldn’t suit\n",
      "the works!” he added looking angrily at the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was the _best_ butter,” the March Hare meekly replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,” the Hatter grumbled:\n",
      "“you shouldn’t have put it in with the bread-knife.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped\n",
      "it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of\n",
      "nothing better to say than his first remark, “It was the _best_ butter,\n",
      "you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. “What a\n",
      "funny watch!” she remarked. “It tells the day of the month, and doesn’t\n",
      "tell what o’clock it is!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why should it?” muttered the Hatter. “Does _your_ watch tell you what\n",
      "year it is?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course not,” Alice replied very readily: “but that’s because it\n",
      "stays the same year for such a long time together.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Which is just the case with _mine_,” said the Hatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter’s remark seemed to have no\n",
      "sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. “I don’t quite\n",
      "understand you,” she said, as politely as she could.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The Dormouse is asleep again,” said the Hatter, and he poured a little\n",
      "hot tea upon its nose.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its\n",
      "eyes, “Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you guessed the riddle yet?” the Hatter said, turning to Alice\n",
      "again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, I give it up,” Alice replied: “what’s the answer?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I haven’t the slightest idea,” said the Hatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nor I,” said the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice sighed wearily. “I think you might do something better with the\n",
      "time,” she said, “than waste it in asking riddles that have no\n",
      "answers.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you knew Time as well as I do,” said the Hatter, “you wouldn’t talk\n",
      "about wasting _it_. It’s _him_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t know what you mean,” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course you don’t!” the Hatter said, tossing his head\n",
      "contemptuously. “I dare say you never even spoke to Time!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perhaps not,” Alice cautiously replied: “but I know I have to beat\n",
      "time when I learn music.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! that accounts for it,” said the Hatter. “He won’t stand beating.\n",
      "Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he’d do almost anything\n",
      "you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o’clock in\n",
      "the morning, just time to begin lessons: you’d only have to whisper a\n",
      "hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,\n",
      "time for dinner!”\n",
      "\n",
      "(“I only wish it was,” the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)\n",
      "\n",
      "“That would be grand, certainly,” said Alice thoughtfully: “but then—I\n",
      "shouldn’t be hungry for it, you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not at first, perhaps,” said the Hatter: “but you could keep it to\n",
      "half-past one as long as you liked.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is that the way _you_ manage?” Alice asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hatter shook his head mournfully. “Not I!” he replied. “We\n",
      "quarrelled last March—just before _he_ went mad, you know—” (pointing\n",
      "with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) “—it was at the great concert\n",
      "given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!\n",
      "How I wonder what you’re at!’\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You know the song, perhaps?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve heard something like it,” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It goes on, you know,” the Hatter continued, “in this way:—\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Up above the world you fly,\n",
      "Like a tea-tray in the sky.\n",
      "                    Twinkle, twinkle—’”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep\n",
      "“_Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle_—” and went on so long that they\n",
      "had to pinch it to make it stop.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I’d hardly finished the first verse,” said the Hatter, “when the\n",
      "Queen jumped up and bawled out, ‘He’s murdering the time! Off with his\n",
      "head!’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How dreadfully savage!” exclaimed Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And ever since that,” the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, “he won’t\n",
      "do a thing I ask! It’s always six o’clock now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A bright idea came into Alice’s head. “Is that the reason so many\n",
      "tea-things are put out here?” she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, that’s it,” said the Hatter with a sigh: “it’s always tea-time,\n",
      "and we’ve no time to wash the things between whiles.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then you keep moving round, I suppose?” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Exactly so,” said the Hatter: “as the things get used up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But what happens when you come to the beginning again?” Alice ventured\n",
      "to ask.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Suppose we change the subject,” the March Hare interrupted, yawning.\n",
      "“I’m getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m afraid I don’t know one,” said Alice, rather alarmed at the\n",
      "proposal.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then the Dormouse shall!” they both cried. “Wake up, Dormouse!” And\n",
      "they pinched it on both sides at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. “I wasn’t asleep,” he said in a\n",
      "hoarse, feeble voice: “I heard every word you fellows were saying.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tell us a story!” said the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, please do!” pleaded Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And be quick about it,” added the Hatter, “or you’ll be asleep again\n",
      "before it’s done.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Once upon a time there were three little sisters,” the Dormouse began\n",
      "in a great hurry; “and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and\n",
      "they lived at the bottom of a well—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What did they live on?” said Alice, who always took a great interest\n",
      "in questions of eating and drinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They lived on treacle,” said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or\n",
      "two.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They couldn’t have done that, you know,” Alice gently remarked;\n",
      "“they’d have been ill.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So they were,” said the Dormouse; “_very_ ill.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of\n",
      "living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: “But\n",
      "why did they live at the bottom of a well?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Take some more tea,” the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve had nothing yet,” Alice replied in an offended tone, “so I can’t\n",
      "take more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You mean you can’t take _less_,” said the Hatter: “it’s very easy to\n",
      "take _more_ than nothing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nobody asked _your_ opinion,” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who’s making personal remarks now?” the Hatter asked triumphantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to\n",
      "some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and\n",
      "repeated her question. “Why did they live at the bottom of a well?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then\n",
      "said, “It was a treacle-well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s no such thing!” Alice was beginning very angrily, but the\n",
      "Hatter and the March Hare went “Sh! sh!” and the Dormouse sulkily\n",
      "remarked, “If you can’t be civil, you’d better finish the story for\n",
      "yourself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, please go on!” Alice said very humbly; “I won’t interrupt again. I\n",
      "dare say there may be _one_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“One, indeed!” said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to\n",
      "go on. “And so these three little sisters—they were learning to draw,\n",
      "you know—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What did they draw?” said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Treacle,” said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I want a clean cup,” interrupted the Hatter: “let’s all move one place\n",
      "on.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare\n",
      "moved into the Dormouse’s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the\n",
      "place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any\n",
      "advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than\n",
      "before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very\n",
      "cautiously: “But I don’t understand. Where did they draw the treacle\n",
      "from?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You can draw water out of a water-well,” said the Hatter; “so I should\n",
      "think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well—eh, stupid?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But they were _in_ the well,” Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing\n",
      "to notice this last remark.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course they were,” said the Dormouse; “—well in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for\n",
      "some time without interrupting it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They were learning to draw,” the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing\n",
      "its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; “and they drew all manner of\n",
      "things—everything that begins with an M—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why with an M?” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why not?” said the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a\n",
      "doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a\n",
      "little shriek, and went on: “—that begins with an M, such as\n",
      "mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness—you know you say\n",
      "things are “much of a muchness”—did you ever see such a thing as a\n",
      "drawing of a muchness?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Really, now you ask me,” said Alice, very much confused, “I don’t\n",
      "think—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then you shouldn’t talk,” said the Hatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in\n",
      "great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and\n",
      "neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she\n",
      "looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:\n",
      "the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into\n",
      "the teapot.\n",
      "\n",
      "“At any rate I’ll never go _there_ again!” said Alice as she picked her\n",
      "way through the wood. “It’s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in\n",
      "all my life!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door\n",
      "leading right into it. “That’s very curious!” she thought. “But\n",
      "everything’s curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.” And\n",
      "in she went.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little\n",
      "glass table. “Now, I’ll manage better this time,” she said to herself,\n",
      "and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that\n",
      "led into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom\n",
      "(she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot\n",
      "high: then she walked down the little passage: and _then_—she found\n",
      "herself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds\n",
      "and the cool fountains.\n",

      "The Queen’s Croquet-Ground\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses\n",
      "growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily\n",
      "painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she\n",
      "went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard\n",
      "one of them say, “Look out now, Five! Don’t go splashing paint over me\n",
      "like that!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I couldn’t help it,” said Five, in a sulky tone; “Seven jogged my\n",
      "elbow.”\n",
      "\n",
      "On which Seven looked up and said, “That’s right, Five! Always lay the\n",
      "blame on others!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_You’d_ better not talk!” said Five. “I heard the Queen say only\n",
      "yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What for?” said the one who had spoken first.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s none of _your_ business, Two!” said Seven.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, it _is_ his business!” said Five, “and I’ll tell him—it was for\n",
      "bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun “Well, of all the unjust\n",
      "things—” when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching\n",
      "them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also,\n",
      "and all of them bowed low.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, “why you are\n",
      "painting those roses?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low\n",
      "voice, “Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a\n",
      "_red_ rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen\n",
      "was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So\n",
      "you see, Miss, we’re doing our best, afore she comes, to—” At this\n",
      "moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called\n",
      "out “The Queen! The Queen!” and the three gardeners instantly threw\n",
      "themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps,\n",
      "and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the\n",
      "three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the\n",
      "corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with\n",
      "diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came\n",
      "the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came\n",
      "jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all\n",
      "ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens,\n",
      "and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a\n",
      "hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went\n",
      "by without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying\n",
      "the King’s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this\n",
      "grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face\n",
      "like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard\n",
      "of such a rule at processions; “and besides, what would be the use of a\n",
      "procession,” thought she, “if people had all to lie down upon their\n",
      "faces, so that they couldn’t see it?” So she stood still where she was,\n",
      "and waited.\n",

      "\n",
      "“Idiot!” said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to\n",

      "\n",
      "“My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,” said Alice very politely;\n",

      "\n",
      "“And who are _these?_” said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners\n",

      "their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of\n",

      "or courtiers, or three of her own children.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How should _I_ know?” said Alice, surprised at her own courage. “It’s\n",

      "\n",
      "The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a\n",
      "moment like a wild beast, screamed “Off with her head! Off—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nonsense!” said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was\n",
      "silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said “Consider, my\n",
      "dear: she is only a child!”\n",

      "down on one knee as he spoke, “we were trying—”\n",

      "to Alice for protection.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You shan’t be beheaded!” said Alice, and she put them into a large\n",
      "flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a\n",
      "minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the\n",
      "others.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are their heads off?” shouted the Queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!” the soldiers shouted\n",

      "\n",

      "evidently meant for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes!” shouted Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come on, then!” roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,\n",
      "wondering very much what would happen next.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s—it’s a very fine day!” said a timid voice at her side. She was\n",
      "walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very,” said Alice: “—where’s the Duchess?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hush! Hush!” said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked\n",
      "anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon\n",
      "tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered “She’s under\n",
      "sentence of execution.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What for?” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did you say ‘What a pity!’?” the Rabbit asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, I didn’t,” said Alice: “I don’t think it’s at all a pity. I said\n",
      "‘What for?’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She boxed the Queen’s ears—” the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little\n",
      "scream of laughter. “Oh, hush!” the Rabbit whispered in a frightened\n",
      "tone. “The Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the\n",
      "Queen said—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Get to your places!” shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and\n",
      "people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each\n",
      "other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game\n",
      "began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground\n",
      "in her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live\n",
      "hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double\n",
      "themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:\n",
      "she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough,\n",
      "under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she\n",
      "had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the\n",
      "hedgehog a blow with its head, it _would_ twist itself round and look\n",
      "up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help\n",
      "bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was\n",
      "going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog\n",
      "had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all\n",
      "this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she\n",
      "wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were\n",
      "always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice\n",
      "soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling\n",
      "all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time\n",
      "the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and\n",
      "shouting “Off with his head!” or “Off with her head!” about once in a\n",
      "minute.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any\n",
      "dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,\n",
      "“and then,” thought she, “what would become of me? They’re dreadfully\n",
      "fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there’s any\n",
      "one left alive!”\n",
      "\n",
      "She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she\n",
      "could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious\n",
      "appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after\n",
      "watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said\n",
      "to herself “It’s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk\n",
      "to.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How are you getting on?” said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth\n",
      "enough for it to speak with.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. “It’s no use\n",
      "speaking to it,” she thought, “till its ears have come, or at least one\n",
      "of them.” In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put\n",
      "down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad\n",
      "she had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there\n",
      "was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t think they play at all fairly,” Alice began, in rather a\n",
      "complaining tone, “and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can’t hear\n",
      "oneself speak—and they don’t seem to have any rules in particular; at\n",
      "least, if there are, nobody attends to them—and you’ve no idea how\n",
      "confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there’s the\n",
      "arch I’ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the\n",
      "ground—and I should have croqueted the Queen’s hedgehog just now, only\n",
      "it ran away when it saw mine coming!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How do you like the Queen?” said the Cat in a low voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not at all,” said Alice: “she’s so extremely—” Just then she noticed\n",
      "that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,\n",
      "“—likely to win, that it’s hardly worth while finishing the game.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Queen smiled and passed on.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who _are_ you talking to?” said the King, going up to Alice, and\n",
      "looking at the Cat’s head with great curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s a friend of mine—a Cheshire Cat,” said Alice: “allow me to\n",
      "introduce it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t like the look of it at all,” said the King: “however, it may\n",
      "kiss my hand if it likes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’d rather not,” the Cat remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t be impertinent,” said the King, “and don’t look at me like\n",
      "that!” He got behind Alice as he spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A cat may look at a king,” said Alice. “I’ve read that in some book,\n",
      "but I don’t remember where.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, it must be removed,” said the King very decidedly, and he called\n",
      "the Queen, who was passing at the moment, “My dear! I wish you would\n",
      "have this cat removed!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or\n",
      "small. “Off with his head!” she said, without even looking round.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll fetch the executioner myself,” said the King eagerly, and he\n",
      "hurried off.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going\n",
      "on, as she heard the Queen’s voice in the distance, screaming with\n",
      "passion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be\n",
      "executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look\n",
      "of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew\n",
      "whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed\n",
      "to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the\n",
      "other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to\n",
      "the other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a\n",
      "helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight\n",
      "was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: “but it doesn’t\n",
      "matter much,” thought Alice, “as all the arches are gone from this side\n",
      "of the ground.” So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not\n",
      "escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her\n",
      "friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite\n",
      "a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between\n",
      "the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,\n",
      "while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle\n",
      "the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they\n",
      "all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly\n",
      "what they said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The executioner’s argument was, that you couldn’t cut off a head unless\n",
      "there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a\n",
      "thing before, and he wasn’t going to begin at _his_ time of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King’s argument was, that anything that had a head could be\n",
      "beheaded, and that you weren’t to talk nonsense.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Queen’s argument was, that if something wasn’t done about it in\n",
      "less than no time she’d have everybody executed, all round. (It was\n",
      "this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and\n",
      "anxious.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice could think of nothing else to say but “It belongs to the\n",
      "Duchess: you’d better ask _her_ about it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She’s in prison,” the Queen said to the executioner: “fetch her here.”\n",
      "And the executioner went off like an arrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Cat’s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the\n",
      "time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so\n",
      "the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it,\n",

      "\n",
      "“When _I’m_ a Duchess,” she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful\n",

      "sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew _that_: then they wouldn’t be\n",
      "so stingy about it, you know—”\n",
      "\n",
      "She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little\n",
      "startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. “You’re thinking\n",
      "about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can’t\n",
      "tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in\n",
      "a bit.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perhaps it hasn’t one,” Alice ventured to remark.\n",

      "\n",
      "Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the\n",
      "Duchess was _very_ ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the\n",
      "right height to rest her chin upon Alice’s shoulder, and it was an\n",
      "uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she\n",
      "bore it as well as she could.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The game’s going on rather better now,” she said, by way of keeping up\n",
      "the conversation a little.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Somebody said,” Alice whispered, “that it’s done by everybody minding\n",

      "\n",
      "“Ah, well! It means much the same thing,” said the Duchess, digging her\n",
      "sharp little chin into Alice’s shoulder as she added, “and the moral of\n",
      "_that_ is—‘Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of\n",
      "themselves.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How fond she is of finding morals in things!” Alice thought to\n",

      "\n",
      "“I dare say you’re wondering why I don’t put my arm round your waist,”\n",
      "the Duchess said after a pause: “the reason is, that I’m doubtful about\n",

      "\n",
      "“He might bite,” Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious\n",
      "to have the experiment tried.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very true,” said the Duchess: “flamingoes and mustard both bite. And\n",
      "the moral of that is—‘Birds of a feather flock together.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Only mustard isn’t a bird,” Alice remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Right, as usual,” said the Duchess: “what a clear way you have of\n",
      "putting things!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s a mineral, I _think_,” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course it is,” said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to\n",
      "everything that Alice said; “there’s a large mustard-mine near here.\n",
      "And the moral of that is—‘The more there is of mine, the less there is\n",
      "of yours.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, I know!” exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last\n",
      "remark, “it’s a vegetable. It doesn’t look like one, but it is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I quite agree with you,” said the Duchess; “and the moral of that\n",
      "is—‘Be what you would seem to be’—or if you’d like it put more\n",
      "simply—‘Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might\n",
      "appear to others that what you were or might have been was not\n",
      "otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be\n",
      "otherwise.’”\n",
      "\n",

      "“if I had it written down: but I can’t quite follow it as you say it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s nothing to what I could say if I chose,” the Duchess replied,\n",
      "in a pleased tone.\n",

      "\n",
      "“A cheap sort of present!” thought Alice. “I’m glad they don’t give\n",

      "loud.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thinking again?” the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp\n",
      "little chin.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve a right to think,” said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to\n",
      "feel a little worried.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Just about as much right,” said the Duchess, “as pigs have to fly; and\n",
      "the m—”\n",
      "\n",
      "But here, to Alice’s great surprise, the Duchess’s voice died away,\n",
      "even in the middle of her favourite word ‘moral,’ and the arm that was\n",
      "linked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the\n",
      "Queen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a\n",
      "thunderstorm.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A fine day, your Majesty!” the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, I give you fair warning,” shouted the Queen, stamping on the\n",

      "\n",
      "The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let’s go on with the game,” the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too\n",
      "much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the\n",
      "croquet-ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen’s absence, and were\n",
      "resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried\n",
      "back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment’s delay\n",
      "would cost them their lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling\n",
      "with the other players, and shouting “Off with his head!” or “Off with\n",
      "her head!” Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the\n",
      "soldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so\n",
      "that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and\n",
      "all the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody\n",
      "and under sentence of execution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, “Have\n",
      "you seen the Mock Turtle yet?”\n",

      "“No,” said Alice. “I don’t even know what a Mock Turtle is.”\n",

      "“I never saw one, or heard of one,” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come on, then,” said the Queen, “and he shall tell you his history,”\n",
      "\n",
      "As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice,\n",
      "to the company generally, “You are all pardoned.” “Come, _that’s_ a\n",
      "good thing!” she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the\n",
      "number of executions the Queen had ordered.\n",
      "\n",
      "They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (If\n",
      "you don’t know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) “Up, lazy\n",
      "thing!” said the Queen, “and take this young lady to see the Mock\n",
      "Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some\n",
      "executions I have ordered;” and she walked off, leaving Alice alone\n",
      "with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature,\n",
      "but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it\n",
      "as to go after that savage Queen: so she waited.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till\n",
      "she was out of sight: then it chuckled. “What fun!” said the Gryphon,\n",
      "half to itself, half to Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What _is_ the fun?” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, _she_,” said the Gryphon. “It’s all her fancy, that: they never\n",
      "executes nobody, you know. Come on!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Everybody says ‘come on!’ here,” thought Alice, as she went slowly\n",
      "after it: “I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!”\n",
      "\n",
      "They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,\n",
      "sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came\n",
      "nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She\n",
      "pitied him deeply. “What is his sorrow?” she asked the Gryphon, and the\n",
      "Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, “It’s all\n",
      "his fancy, that: he hasn’t got no sorrow, you know. Come on!”\n",
      "\n",
      "So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes\n",
      "full of tears, but said nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This here young lady,” said the Gryphon, “she wants for to know your\n",
      "history, she do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll tell it her,” said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: “sit\n",
      "down, both of you, and don’t speak a word till I’ve finished.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to\n",
      "herself, “I don’t see how he can _ever_ finish, if he doesn’t begin.”\n",
      "But she waited patiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Once,” said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, “I was a real\n",
      "Turtle.”\n",
      "\n",
      "These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an\n",
      "occasional exclamation of “Hjckrrh!” from the Gryphon, and the constant\n",
      "heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and\n",
      "saying, “Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,” but she could not\n",
      "help thinking there _must_ be more to come, so she sat still and said\n",
      "nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When we were little,” the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,\n",
      "though still sobbing a little now and then, “we went to school in the\n",
      "sea. The master was an old Turtle—we used to call him Tortoise—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn’t one?” Alice asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We called him Tortoise because he taught us,” said the Mock Turtle\n",
      "angrily: “really you are very dull!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple\n",
      "question,” added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked\n",
      "at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the\n",
      "Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, “Drive on, old fellow! Don’t be all\n",
      "day about it!” and he went on in these words:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn’t believe it—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I never said I didn’t!” interrupted Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You did,” said the Mock Turtle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hold your tongue!” added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.\n",
      "The Mock Turtle went on.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We had the best of educations—in fact, we went to school every day—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_I’ve_ been to a day-school, too,” said Alice; “you needn’t be so\n",
      "proud as all that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“With extras?” asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said Alice, “we learned French and music.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And washing?” said the Mock Turtle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Certainly not!” said Alice indignantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! then yours wasn’t a really good school,” said the Mock Turtle in a\n",
      "tone of great relief. “Now at _ours_ they had at the end of the bill,\n",
      "‘French, music, _and washing_—extra.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You couldn’t have wanted it much,” said Alice; “living at the bottom\n",
      "of the sea.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I couldn’t afford to learn it.” said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. “I\n",
      "only took the regular course.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What was that?” inquired Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,” the Mock Turtle\n",
      "replied; “and then the different branches of Arithmetic—Ambition,\n",
      "Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I never heard of ‘Uglification,’” Alice ventured to say. “What is it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. “What! Never heard of\n",
      "uglifying!” it exclaimed. “You know what to beautify is, I suppose?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said Alice doubtfully: “it means—to—make—anything—prettier.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, then,” the Gryphon went on, “if you don’t know what to uglify\n",
      "is, you _are_ a simpleton.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so\n",
      "she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said “What else had you to learn?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, there was Mystery,” the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the\n",
      "subjects on his flappers, “—Mystery, ancient and modern, with\n",
      "Seaography: then Drawling—the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,\n",
      "that used to come once a week: _he_ taught us Drawling, Stretching, and\n",
      "Fainting in Coils.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What was _that_ like?” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I can’t show it you myself,” the Mock Turtle said: “I’m too\n",
      "stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hadn’t time,” said the Gryphon: “I went to the Classics master,\n",
      "though. He was an old crab, _he_ was.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I never went to him,” the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: “he taught\n",
      "Laughing and Grief, they used to say.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So he did, so he did,” said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both\n",
      "creatures hid their faces in their paws.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And how many hours a day did you do lessons?” said Alice, in a hurry\n",
      "to change the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ten hours the first day,” said the Mock Turtle: “nine the next, and so\n",
      "on.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What a curious plan!” exclaimed Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s the reason they’re called lessons,” the Gryphon remarked:\n",
      "“because they lessen from day to day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little\n",
      "before she made her next remark. “Then the eleventh day must have been\n",
      "a holiday?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course it was,” said the Mock Turtle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And how did you manage on the twelfth?” Alice went on eagerly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s enough about lessons,” the Gryphon interrupted in a very\n",
      "decided tone: “tell her something about the games now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CHAPTER X.\n",
      "The Lobster Quadrille\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across\n",
      "his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or\n",
      "two sobs choked his voice. “Same as if he had a bone in his throat,”\n",
      "said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in\n",
      "the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears\n",
      "running down his cheeks, he went on again:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“You may not have lived much under the sea—” (“I haven’t,” said\n",
      "Alice)—“and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster—”\n",
      "(Alice began to say “I once tasted—” but checked herself hastily, and\n",
      "said “No, never”) “—so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a\n",
      "Lobster Quadrille is!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, indeed,” said Alice. “What sort of a dance is it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why,” said the Gryphon, “you first form into a line along the\n",
      "sea-shore—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Two lines!” cried the Mock Turtle. “Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;\n",
      "then, when you’ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_That_ generally takes some time,” interrupted the Gryphon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“—you advance twice—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Each with a lobster as a partner!” cried the Gryphon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course,” the Mock Turtle said: “advance twice, set to partners—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“—change lobsters, and retire in same order,” continued the Gryphon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then, you know,” the Mock Turtle went on, “you throw the—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The lobsters!” shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.\n",
      "\n",
      "“—as far out to sea as you can—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Swim after them!” screamed the Gryphon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Turn a somersault in the sea!” cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly\n",
      "about.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Change lobsters again!” yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Back to land again, and that’s all the first figure,” said the Mock\n",
      "Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had\n",
      "been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very\n",
      "sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It must be a very pretty dance,” said Alice timidly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Would you like to see a little of it?” said the Mock Turtle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very much indeed,” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come, let’s try the first figure!” said the Mock Turtle to the\n",
      "Gryphon. “We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, _you_ sing,” said the Gryphon. “I’ve forgotten the words.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and\n",
      "then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their\n",
      "forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly\n",
      "and sadly:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Will you walk a little faster?” said a whiting to a snail.\n",
      "“There’s a porpoise close behind us, and he’s treading on my tail.\n",
      "See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!\n",
      "They are waiting on the shingle—will you come and join the dance?\n",
      "Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?\n",
      "Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?\n",
      "\n",
      "“You can really have no notion how delightful it will be\n",
      "When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!”\n",
      "But the snail replied “Too far, too far!” and gave a look askance—\n",
      "Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.\n",
      "Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.\n",
      "Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What matters it how far we go?” his scaly friend replied.\n",
      "“There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.\n",
      "The further off from England the nearer is to France—\n",
      "Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.\n",
      "Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?\n",
      "Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thank you, it’s a very interesting dance to watch,” said Alice,\n",
      "feeling very glad that it was over at last: “and I do so like that\n",
      "curious song about the whiting!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, as to the whiting,” said the Mock Turtle, “they—you’ve seen them,\n",
      "of course?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said Alice, “I’ve often seen them at dinn—” she checked herself\n",
      "hastily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t know where Dinn may be,” said the Mock Turtle, “but if you’ve\n",
      "seen them so often, of course you know what they’re like.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I believe so,” Alice replied thoughtfully. “They have their tails in\n",
      "their mouths—and they’re all over crumbs.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’re wrong about the crumbs,” said the Mock Turtle: “crumbs would\n",
      "all wash off in the sea. But they _have_ their tails in their mouths;\n",
      "and the reason is—” here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his\n",
      "eyes.—“Tell her about the reason and all that,” he said to the Gryphon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The reason is,” said the Gryphon, “that they _would_ go with the\n",
      "lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to\n",
      "fall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they\n",
      "couldn’t get them out again. That’s all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thank you,” said Alice, “it’s very interesting. I never knew so much\n",
      "about a whiting before.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can tell you more than that, if you like,” said the Gryphon. “Do you\n",
      "know why it’s called a whiting?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I never thought about it,” said Alice. “Why?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_It does the boots and shoes_,” the Gryphon replied very solemnly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was thoroughly puzzled. “Does the boots and shoes!” she repeated\n",
      "in a wondering tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, what are _your_ shoes done with?” said the Gryphon. “I mean, what\n",
      "makes them so shiny?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her\n",
      "answer. “They’re done with blacking, I believe.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Boots and shoes under the sea,” the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,\n",
      "“are done with a whiting. Now you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And what are they made of?” Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Soles and eels, of course,” the Gryphon replied rather impatiently:\n",
      "“any shrimp could have told you that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If I’d been the whiting,” said Alice, whose thoughts were still\n",
      "running on the song, “I’d have said to the porpoise, ‘Keep back,\n",
      "please: we don’t want _you_ with us!’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They were obliged to have him with them,” the Mock Turtle said: “no\n",
      "wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wouldn’t it really?” said Alice in a tone of great surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course not,” said the Mock Turtle: “why, if a fish came to _me_,\n",
      "and told me he was going a journey, I should say ‘With what porpoise?’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t you mean ‘purpose’?” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I mean what I say,” the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And\n",
      "the Gryphon added “Come, let’s hear some of _your_ adventures.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I could tell you my adventures—beginning from this morning,” said\n",
      "Alice a little timidly: “but it’s no use going back to yesterday,\n",
      "because I was a different person then.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Explain all that,” said the Mock Turtle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, no! The adventures first,” said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:\n",
      "“explanations take such a dreadful time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first\n",
      "saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first,\n",
      "the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened\n",
      "their eyes and mouths so _very_ wide, but she gained courage as she\n",
      "went on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part\n",
      "about her repeating “_You are old, Father William_,” to the\n",
      "Caterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock\n",
      "Turtle drew a long breath, and said “That’s very curious.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s all about as curious as it can be,” said the Gryphon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It all came different!” the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. “I\n",
      "should like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to\n",
      "begin.” He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of\n",
      "authority over Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Stand up and repeat ‘’_Tis the voice of the sluggard_,’” said the\n",
      "Gryphon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!”\n",
      "thought Alice; “I might as well be at school at once.” However, she got\n",
      "up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster\n",
      "Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came\n",
      "very queer indeed:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“’Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,\n",
      "“You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.”\n",
      "As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose\n",
      "Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "[later editions continued as follows\n",
      "When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,\n",
      "And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,\n",
      "But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,\n",
      "His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s different from what _I_ used to say when I was a child,” said\n",
      "the Gryphon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I never heard it before,” said the Mock Turtle; “but it sounds\n",
      "uncommon nonsense.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,\n",
      "wondering if anything would _ever_ happen in a natural way again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should like to have it explained,” said the Mock Turtle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She can’t explain it,” said the Gryphon hastily. “Go on with the next\n",
      "verse.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But about his toes?” the Mock Turtle persisted. “How _could_ he turn\n",
      "them out with his nose, you know?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s the first position in dancing.” Alice said; but was dreadfully\n",
      "puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Go on with the next verse,” the Gryphon repeated impatiently: “it\n",
      "begins ‘_I passed by his garden_.’”\n",

      "Who Stole the Tarts?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they\n",
      "arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them—all sorts of little\n",
      "birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was\n",
      "standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard\n",
      "him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one\n",
      "hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the\n",
      "court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so\n",
      "good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them—“I wish they’d\n",
      "get the trial done,” she thought, “and hand round the refreshments!”\n",
      "But there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at\n",
      "everything about her, to pass away the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read\n",
      "about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew\n",
      "the name of nearly everything there. “That’s the judge,” she said to\n",
      "herself, “because of his great wig.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the\n",
      "wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he\n",
      "did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And that’s the jury-box,” thought Alice, “and those twelve creatures,”\n",
      "(she was obliged to say “creatures,” you see, because some of them were\n",
      "animals, and some were birds,) “I suppose they are the jurors.” She\n",
      "said this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather\n",
      "proud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little\n",
      "girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. However, “jury-men”\n",
      "would have done just as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. “What are\n",
      "they doing?” Alice whispered to the Gryphon. “They can’t have anything\n",
      "to put down yet, before the trial’s begun.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They’re putting down their names,” the Gryphon whispered in reply,\n",
      "“for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Stupid things!” Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she\n",
      "stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, “Silence in the\n",
      "court!” and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round,\n",
      "to make out who was talking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,\n",
      "that all the jurors were writing down “stupid things!” on their slates,\n",
      "and she could even make out that one of them didn’t know how to spell\n",
      "“stupid,” and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. “A nice\n",
      "muddle their slates’ll be in before the trial’s over!” thought Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice\n",
      "could _not_ stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and\n",
      "very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly\n",
      "that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out\n",
      "at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he\n",
      "was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this\n",
      "was of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Herald, read the accusation!” said the King.\n",
      "\n",
      "On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then\n",
      "unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,\n",
      "    All on a summer day:\n",
      "The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,\n",
      "    And took them quite away!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Consider your verdict,” the King said to the jury.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not yet, not yet!” the Rabbit hastily interrupted. “There’s a great\n",
      "deal to come before that!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Call the first witness,” said the King; and the White Rabbit blew\n",
      "three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, “First witness!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand\n",
      "and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. “I beg pardon, your\n",
      "Majesty,” he began, “for bringing these in: but I hadn’t quite finished\n",
      "my tea when I was sent for.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You ought to have finished,” said the King. “When did you begin?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the\n",
      "court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. “Fourteenth of March, I _think_ it\n",
      "was,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fifteenth,” said the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sixteenth,” added the Dormouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Write that down,” the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly\n",
      "wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and\n",
      "reduced the answer to shillings and pence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Take off your hat,” the King said to the Hatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It isn’t mine,” said the Hatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“_Stolen!_” the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made\n",
      "a memorandum of the fact.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I keep them to sell,” the Hatter added as an explanation; “I’ve none\n",
      "of my own. I’m a hatter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,\n",
      "who turned pale and fidgeted.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Give your evidence,” said the King; “and don’t be nervous, or I’ll\n",
      "have you executed on the spot.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting\n",
      "from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his\n",
      "confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the\n",
      "bread-and-butter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled\n",
      "her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to\n",
      "grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave\n",
      "the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was\n",
      "as long as there was room for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wish you wouldn’t squeeze so.” said the Dormouse, who was sitting\n",
      "next to her. “I can hardly breathe.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can’t help it,” said Alice very meekly: “I’m growing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’ve no right to grow _here_,” said the Dormouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t talk nonsense,” said Alice more boldly: “you know you’re growing\n",
      "too.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, but _I_ grow at a reasonable pace,” said the Dormouse: “not in\n",
      "that ridiculous fashion.” And he got up very sulkily and crossed over\n",
      "to the other side of the court.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,\n",
      "just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers\n",
      "of the court, “Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!”\n",
      "on which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes\n",
      "off.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Give your evidence,” the King repeated angrily, “or I’ll have you\n",
      "executed, whether you’re nervous or not.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m a poor man, your Majesty,” the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,\n",
      "“—and I hadn’t begun my tea—not above a week or so—and what with the\n",
      "bread-and-butter getting so thin—and the twinkling of the tea—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The twinkling of the _what?_” said the King.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It _began_ with the tea,” the Hatter replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course twinkling begins with a T!” said the King sharply. “Do you\n",
      "take me for a dunce? Go on!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m a poor man,” the Hatter went on, “and most things twinkled after\n",
      "that—only the March Hare said—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I didn’t!” the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You did!” said the Hatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I deny it!” said the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He denies it,” said the King: “leave out that part.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said—” the Hatter went on, looking\n",
      "anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied\n",
      "nothing, being fast asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "“After that,” continued the Hatter, “I cut some more bread-and-butter—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But what did the Dormouse say?” one of the jury asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That I can’t remember,” said the Hatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You _must_ remember,” remarked the King, “or I’ll have you executed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went\n",
      "down on one knee. “I’m a poor man, your Majesty,” he began.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’re a _very_ poor _speaker_,” said the King.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by\n",
      "the officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just\n",
      "explain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied\n",
      "up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,\n",
      "head first, and then sat upon it.)\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m glad I’ve seen that done,” thought Alice. “I’ve so often read in\n",
      "the newspapers, at the end of trials, “There was some attempts at\n",
      "applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the\n",
      "court,” and I never understood what it meant till now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If that’s all you know about it, you may stand down,” continued the\n",
      "King.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can’t go no lower,” said the Hatter: “I’m on the floor, as it is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then you may _sit_ down,” the King replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!” thought Alice. “Now we shall get\n",
      "on better.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’d rather finish my tea,” said the Hatter, with an anxious look at\n",
      "the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You may go,” said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,\n",
      "without even waiting to put his shoes on.\n",
      "\n",
      "“—and just take his head off outside,” the Queen added to one of the\n",
      "officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get\n",
      "to the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Call the next witness!” said the King.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next witness was the Duchess’s cook. She carried the pepper-box in\n",
      "her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the\n",
      "court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Give your evidence,” said the King.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shan’t,” said the cook.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,\n",
      "“Your Majesty must cross-examine _this_ witness.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, if I must, I must,” the King said, with a melancholy air, and,\n",
      "after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were\n",
      "nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, “What are tarts made of?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pepper, mostly,” said the cook.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Treacle,” said a sleepy voice behind her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Collar that Dormouse,” the Queen shrieked out. “Behead that Dormouse!\n",
      "Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his\n",
      "whiskers!”\n",
      "\n",
      "For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse\n",
      "turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had\n",
      "disappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never mind!” said the King, with an air of great relief. “Call the\n",
      "next witness.” And he added in an undertone to the Queen, “Really, my\n",
      "dear, _you_ must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my\n",
      "forehead ache!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling\n",
      "very curious to see what the next witness would be like, “—for they\n",
      "haven’t got much evidence _yet_,” she said to herself. Imagine her\n",
      "surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill\n",
      "little voice, the name “Alice!”\n",

      "Alice’s Evidence\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here!” cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how\n",
      "large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such\n",
      "a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,\n",
      "upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there\n",
      "they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of\n",
      "goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, I _beg_ your pardon!” she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and\n",
      "began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident\n",
      "of the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of\n",
      "idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the\n",
      "jury-box, or they would die.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The trial cannot proceed,” said the King in a very grave voice, “until\n",
      "all the jurymen are back in their proper places—_all_,” he repeated\n",
      "with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put\n",
      "the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its\n",
      "tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon\n",
      "got it out again, and put it right; “not that it signifies much,” she\n",
      "said to herself; “I should think it would be _quite_ as much use in the\n",
      "trial one way up as the other.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being\n",
      "upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to\n",
      "them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the\n",
      "accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do\n",
      "anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the\n",
      "court.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you know about this business?” the King said to Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing,” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing _whatever?_” persisted the King.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing whatever,” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s very important,” the King said, turning to the jury. They were\n",
      "just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White\n",
      "Rabbit interrupted: “_Un_important, your Majesty means, of course,” he\n",
      "said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as\n",
      "he spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "“_Un_important, of course, I meant,” the King hastily said, and went on\n",
      "to himself in an undertone,\n",
      "\n",
      "“important—unimportant—unimportant—important—” as if he were trying\n",
      "which word sounded best.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the jury wrote it down “important,” and some “unimportant.”\n",
      "Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates;\n",
      "“but it doesn’t matter a bit,” she thought to herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in\n",
      "his note-book, cackled out “Silence!” and read out from his book, “Rule\n",
      "Forty-two. _All persons more than a mile high to leave the court_.”\n",

      "The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. “Consider your\n",
      "verdict,” he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,” said the\n",

      "\n",

      "again—‘_before she had this fit_—’ you never had fits, my dear, I\n",
      "think?” he said to the Queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never!” said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard\n",
      "as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his\n",
      "slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily\n",
      "began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long\n",
      "as it lasted.)\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then the words don’t _fit_ you,” said the King, looking round the\n",

      "\n",
      "“It’s a pun!” the King added in an offended tone, and everybody\n",
      "laughed, “Let the jury consider their verdict,” the King said, for\n",
      "about the twentieth time that day.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, no!” said the Queen. “Sentence first—verdict afterwards.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“I won’t!” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Off with her head!” the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody\n",
      "moved.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who cares for you?” said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by\n",
      "this time.) “You’re nothing but a pack of cards!”\n",
      "\n",
      "At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon\n",
      "her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and\n",
      "tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her\n",
      "head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead\n",
      "leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wake up, Alice dear!” said her sister; “Why, what a long sleep you’ve\n",
      "had!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, I’ve had such a curious dream!” said Alice, and she told her\n",
      "sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange\n",
      "Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she\n",
      "had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, “It _was_ a curious\n",
      "dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it’s getting late.”\n",
      "So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,\n",
      "what a wonderful dream it had been.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her\n",
      "hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all\n",
      "her wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion,\n",
      "and this was her dream:—\n",
      "\n",
      "First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny\n",
      "hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were\n",
      "looking up into hers—she could hear the very tones of her voice, and\n",
      "see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair\n",
      "that _would_ always get into her eyes—and still as she listened, or\n",
      "seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the\n",
      "strange creatures of her little sister’s dream.\n",
      "\n",
      "The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by—the\n",
      "frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool—she\n",
      "could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends\n",
      "shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen\n",
      "ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution—once more the pig-baby\n",
      "was sneezing on the Duchess’s knee, while plates and dishes crashed\n",
      "around it—once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the\n",
      "Lizard’s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,\n",
      "filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock\n",
      "Turtle.\n",
      "\n",
      "So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in\n",
      "Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all\n",
      "would change to dull reality—the grass would be only rustling in the\n",
      "wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds—the rattling\n",
      "teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen’s shrill\n",
      "cries to the voice of the shepherd boy—and the sneeze of the baby, the\n",
      "shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change\n",
      "(she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard—while the\n",
      "lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock\n",
      "Turtle’s heavy sobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers\n",
      "would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would\n",
      "keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her\n",
      "childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children,\n",
      "and make _their_ eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale,\n",
      "perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she\n",
      "would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all\n",
      "their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer\n",
      "days.\n",

      "\n",
      "One thing was certain, that the _white_ kitten had had nothing to do\n",
      "with it:—it was the black kitten’s fault entirely. For the white kitten\n",
      "had been having its face washed by the old cat for the last quarter of\n",
      "an hour (and bearing it pretty well, considering); so you see that it\n",
      "_couldn’t_ have had any hand in the mischief.\n",
      "\n",
      "The way Dinah washed her children’s faces was this: first she held the\n",
      "poor thing down by its ear with one paw, and then with the other paw\n",
      "she rubbed its face all over, the wrong way, beginning at the nose: and\n",
      "just now, as I said, she was hard at work on the white kitten, which\n",
      "was lying quite still and trying to purr—no doubt feeling that it was\n",
      "all meant for its good.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the black kitten had been finished with earlier in the afternoon,\n",
      "and so, while Alice was sitting curled up in a corner of the great\n",
      "arm-chair, half talking to herself and half asleep, the kitten had been\n",
      "having a grand game of romps with the ball of worsted Alice had been\n",
      "trying to wind up, and had been rolling it up and down till it had all\n",
      "come undone again; and there it was, spread over the hearth-rug, all\n",
      "knots and tangles, with the kitten running after its own tail in the\n",
      "middle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, you wicked little thing!” cried Alice, catching up the kitten, and\n",
      "giving it a little kiss to make it understand that it was in disgrace.\n",
      "“Really, Dinah ought to have taught you better manners! You _ought_,\n",
      "Dinah, you know you ought!” she added, looking reproachfully at the old\n",
      "cat, and speaking in as cross a voice as she could manage—and then she\n",
      "scrambled back into the arm-chair, taking the kitten and the worsted\n",
      "with her, and began winding up the ball again. But she didn’t get on\n",
      "very fast, as she was talking all the time, sometimes to the kitten,\n",
      "and sometimes to herself. Kitty sat very demurely on her knee,\n",
      "pretending to watch the progress of the winding, and now and then\n",
      "putting out one paw and gently touching the ball, as if it would be\n",
      "glad to help, if it might.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you know what to-morrow is, Kitty?” Alice began. “You’d have\n",
      "guessed if you’d been up in the window with me—only Dinah was making\n",
      "you tidy, so you couldn’t. I was watching the boys getting in sticks\n",
      "for the bonfire—and it wants plenty of sticks, Kitty! Only it got so\n",
      "cold, and it snowed so, they had to leave off. Never mind, Kitty, we’ll\n",
      "go and see the bonfire to-morrow.” Here Alice wound two or three turns\n",
      "of the worsted round the kitten’s neck, just to see how it would look:\n",
      "this led to a scramble, in which the ball rolled down upon the floor,\n",
      "and yards and yards of it got unwound again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you know, I was so angry, Kitty,” Alice went on as soon as they\n",
      "were comfortably settled again, “when I saw all the mischief you had\n",
      "been doing, I was very nearly opening the window, and putting you out\n",
      "into the snow! And you’d have deserved it, you little mischievous\n",
      "darling! What have you got to say for yourself? Now don’t interrupt\n",
      "me!” she went on, holding up one finger. “I’m going to tell you all\n",
      "your faults. Number one: you squeaked twice while Dinah was washing\n",
      "your face this morning. Now you can’t deny it, Kitty: I heard you!\n",
      "What’s that you say?” (pretending that the kitten was speaking.) “Her\n",
      "paw went into your eye? Well, that’s _your_ fault, for keeping your\n",
      "eyes open—if you’d shut them tight up, it wouldn’t have happened. Now\n",
      "don’t make any more excuses, but listen! Number two: you pulled\n",
      "Snowdrop away by the tail just as I had put down the saucer of milk\n",
      "before her! What, you were thirsty, were you? How do you know she\n",
      "wasn’t thirsty too? Now for number three: you unwound every bit of the\n",
      "worsted while I wasn’t looking!\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s three faults, Kitty, and you’ve not been punished for any of\n",
      "them yet. You know I’m saving up all your punishments for Wednesday\n",
      "week—Suppose they had saved up all _my_ punishments!” she went on,\n",
      "talking more to herself than the kitten. “What _would_ they do at the\n",
      "end of a year? I should be sent to prison, I suppose, when the day\n",
      "came. Or—let me see—suppose each punishment was to be going without a\n",
      "dinner: then, when the miserable day came, I should have to go without\n",
      "fifty dinners at once! Well, I shouldn’t mind _that_ much! I’d far\n",
      "rather go without them than eat them!\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you hear the snow against the window-panes, Kitty? How nice and\n",
      "soft it sounds! Just as if some one was kissing the window all over\n",
      "outside. I wonder if the snow _loves_ the trees and fields, that it\n",
      "kisses them so gently? And then it covers them up snug, you know, with\n",
      "a white quilt; and perhaps it says, ‘Go to sleep, darlings, till the\n",
      "summer comes again.’ And when they wake up in the summer, Kitty, they\n",
      "dress themselves all in green, and dance about—whenever the wind\n",
      "blows—oh, that’s very pretty!” cried Alice, dropping the ball of\n",
      "worsted to clap her hands. “And I do so _wish_ it was true! I’m sure\n",
      "the woods look sleepy in the autumn, when the leaves are getting brown.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Kitty, can you play chess? Now, don’t smile, my dear, I’m asking it\n",
      "seriously. Because, when we were playing just now, you watched just as\n",
      "if you understood it: and when I said ‘Check!’ you purred! Well, it\n",
      "_was_ a nice check, Kitty, and really I might have won, if it hadn’t\n",
      "been for that nasty Knight, that came wiggling down among my pieces.\n",
      "Kitty, dear, let’s pretend—” And here I wish I could tell you half the\n",
      "things Alice used to say, beginning with her favourite phrase “Let’s\n",
      "pretend.” She had had quite a long argument with her sister only the\n",
      "day before—all because Alice had begun with “Let’s pretend we’re kings\n",
      "and queens;” and her sister, who liked being very exact, had argued\n",
      "that they couldn’t, because there were only two of them, and Alice had\n",
      "been reduced at last to say, “Well, _you_ can be one of them then, and\n",
      "_I’ll_ be all the rest.” And once she had really frightened her old\n",
      "nurse by shouting suddenly in her ear, “Nurse! Do let’s pretend that\n",
      "I’m a hungry hyaena, and you’re a bone.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But this is taking us away from Alice’s speech to the kitten. “Let’s\n",
      "pretend that you’re the Red Queen, Kitty! Do you know, I think if you\n",
      "sat up and folded your arms, you’d look exactly like her. Now do try,\n",
      "there’s a dear!” And Alice got the Red Queen off the table, and set it\n",
      "up before the kitten as a model for it to imitate: however, the thing\n",
      "didn’t succeed, principally, Alice said, because the kitten wouldn’t\n",
      "fold its arms properly. So, to punish it, she held it up to the\n",
      "Looking-glass, that it might see how sulky it was—“and if you’re not\n",
      "good directly,” she added, “I’ll put you through into Looking-glass\n",
      "House. How would you like _that_?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, if you’ll only attend, Kitty, and not talk so much, I’ll tell you\n",
      "all my ideas about Looking-glass House. First, there’s the room you can\n",
      "see through the glass—that’s just the same as our drawing room, only\n",
      "the things go the other way. I can see all of it when I get upon a\n",
      "chair—all but the bit behind the fireplace. Oh! I do so wish I could\n",
      "see _that_ bit! I want so much to know whether they’ve a fire in the\n",
      "winter: you never _can_ tell, you know, unless our fire smokes, and\n",
      "then smoke comes up in that room too—but that may be only pretence,\n",
      "just to make it look as if they had a fire. Well then, the books are\n",
      "something like our books, only the words go the wrong way; I know that,\n",
      "because I’ve held up one of our books to the glass, and then they hold\n",

      "\n",
      "“How would you like to live in Looking-glass House, Kitty? I wonder if\n",
      "they’d give you milk in there? Perhaps Looking-glass milk isn’t good to\n",
      "drink—But oh, Kitty! now we come to the passage. You can just see a\n",
      "little _peep_ of the passage in Looking-glass House, if you leave the\n",
      "door of our drawing-room wide open: and it’s very like our passage as\n",
      "far as you can see, only you know it may be quite different on beyond.\n",
      "Oh, Kitty! how nice it would be if we could only get through into\n",
      "Looking-glass House! I’m sure it’s got, oh! such beautiful things in\n",
      "it! Let’s pretend there’s a way of getting through into it, somehow,\n",
      "Kitty. Let’s pretend the glass has got all soft like gauze, so that we\n",
      "can get through. Why, it’s turning into a sort of mist now, I declare!\n",
      "It’ll be easy enough to get through—” She was up on the chimney-piece\n",
      "while she said this, though she hardly knew how she had got there. And\n",
      "certainly the glass _was_ beginning to melt away, just like a bright\n",
      "silvery mist.\n",
      "\n",
      "In another moment Alice was through the glass, and had jumped lightly\n",
      "down into the Looking-glass room. The very first thing she did was to\n",
      "look whether there was a fire in the fireplace, and she was quite\n",
      "pleased to find that there was a real one, blazing away as brightly as\n",
      "the one she had left behind. “So I shall be as warm here as I was in\n",
      "the old room,” thought Alice: “warmer, in fact, because there’ll be no\n",
      "one here to scold me away from the fire. Oh, what fun it’ll be, when\n",
      "they see me through the glass in here, and can’t get at me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she began looking about, and noticed that what could be seen from\n",
      "the old room was quite common and uninteresting, but that all the rest\n",
      "was as different as possible. For instance, the pictures on the wall\n",
      "next the fire seemed to be all alive, and the very clock on the\n",
      "chimney-piece (you know you can only see the back of it in the\n",
      "Looking-glass) had got the face of a little old man, and grinned at\n",
      "her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They don’t keep this room so tidy as the other,” Alice thought to\n",
      "herself, as she noticed several of the chessmen down in the hearth\n",
      "among the cinders: but in another moment, with a little “Oh!” of\n",
      "surprise, she was down on her hands and knees watching them. The\n",
      "chessmen were walking about, two and two!\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here are the Red King and the Red Queen,” Alice said (in a whisper,\n",
      "for fear of frightening them), “and there are the White King and the\n",
      "White Queen sitting on the edge of the shovel—and here are two castles\n",
      "walking arm in arm—I don’t think they can hear me,” she went on, as she\n",
      "put her head closer down, “and I’m nearly sure they can’t see me. I\n",
      "feel somehow as if I were invisible—”\n",
      "\n",
      "Here something began squeaking on the table behind Alice, and made her\n",
      "turn her head just in time to see one of the White Pawns roll over and\n",
      "begin kicking: she watched it with great curiosity to see what would\n",
      "happen next.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is the voice of my child!” the White Queen cried out as she rushed\n",
      "past the King, so violently that she knocked him over among the\n",
      "cinders. “My precious Lily! My imperial kitten!” and she began\n",
      "scrambling wildly up the side of the fender.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Imperial fiddlestick!” said the King, rubbing his nose, which had been\n",
      "hurt by the fall. He had a right to be a _little_ annoyed with the\n",
      "Queen, for he was covered with ashes from head to foot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was very anxious to be of use, and, as the poor little Lily was\n",
      "nearly screaming herself into a fit, she hastily picked up the Queen\n",
      "and set her on the table by the side of her noisy little daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Queen gasped, and sat down: the rapid journey through the air had\n",
      "quite taken away her breath and for a minute or two she could do\n",
      "nothing but hug the little Lily in silence. As soon as she had\n",
      "recovered her breath a little, she called out to the White King, who\n",
      "was sitting sulkily among the ashes, “Mind the volcano!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What volcano?” said the King, looking up anxiously into the fire, as\n",
      "if he thought that was the most likely place to find one.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Blew—me—up,” panted the Queen, who was still a little out of breath.\n",
      "“Mind you come up—the regular way—don’t get blown up!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice watched the White King as he slowly struggled up from bar to bar,\n",
      "till at last she said, “Why, you’ll be hours and hours getting to the\n",
      "table, at that rate. I’d far better help you, hadn’t I?” But the King\n",
      "took no notice of the question: it was quite clear that he could\n",
      "neither hear her nor see her.\n",
      "\n",
      "So Alice picked him up very gently, and lifted him across more slowly\n",
      "than she had lifted the Queen, that she mightn’t take his breath away:\n",
      "but, before she put him on the table, she thought she might as well\n",
      "dust him a little, he was so covered with ashes.\n",
      "\n",
      "She said afterwards that she had never seen in all her life such a face\n",
      "as the King made, when he found himself held in the air by an invisible\n",
      "hand, and being dusted: he was far too much astonished to cry out, but\n",
      "his eyes and his mouth went on getting larger and larger, and rounder\n",
      "and rounder, till her hand shook so with laughing that she nearly let\n",
      "him drop upon the floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! _please_ don’t make such faces, my dear!” she cried out, quite\n",
      "forgetting that the King couldn’t hear her. “You make me laugh so that\n",
      "I can hardly hold you! And don’t keep your mouth so wide open! All the\n",
      "ashes will get into it—there, now I think you’re tidy enough!” she\n",
      "added, as she smoothed his hair, and set him upon the table near the\n",
      "Queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King immediately fell flat on his back, and lay perfectly still:\n",
      "and Alice was a little alarmed at what she had done, and went round the\n",
      "room to see if she could find any water to throw over him. However, she\n",
      "could find nothing but a bottle of ink, and when she got back with it\n",
      "she found he had recovered, and he and the Queen were talking together\n",
      "in a frightened whisper—so low, that Alice could hardly hear what they\n",
      "said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King was saying, “I assure, you my dear, I turned cold to the very\n",
      "ends of my whiskers!”\n",
      "\n",
      "To which the Queen replied, “You haven’t got any whiskers.”\n",
      "\n",

      "forget!”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Alice looked on with great interest as the King took an enormous\n",
      "memorandum-book out of his pocket, and began writing. A sudden thought\n",
      "struck her, and she took hold of the end of the pencil, which came some\n",
      "way over his shoulder, and began writing for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The poor King looked puzzled and unhappy, and struggled with the pencil\n",
      "for some time without saying anything; but Alice was too strong for\n",
      "him, and at last he panted out, “My dear! I really _must_ get a thinner\n",

      "that I don’t intend—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What manner of things?” said the Queen, looking over the book (in\n",

      "\n",
      "There was a book lying near Alice on the table, and while she sat\n",
      "watching the White King (for she was still a little anxious about him,\n",
      "and had the ink all ready to throw over him, in case he fainted again),\n",
      "she turned over the leaves, to find some part that she could read,\n",

      "She was out of the room in a moment, and ran down stairs—or, at least,\n",
      "it wasn’t exactly running, but a new invention of hers for getting down\n",
      "stairs quickly and easily, as Alice said to herself. She just kept the\n",
      "tips of her fingers on the hand-rail, and floated gently down without\n",
      "even touching the stairs with her feet; then she floated on through the\n",
      "hall, and would have gone straight out at the door in the same way, if\n",
      "she hadn’t caught hold of the door-post. She was getting a little giddy\n",
      "with so much floating in the air, and was rather glad to find herself\n",
      "walking again in the natural way.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CHAPTER II.\n",
      "The Garden of Live Flowers\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should see the garden far better,” said Alice to herself, “if I\n",
      "could get to the top of that hill: and here’s a path that leads\n",
      "straight to it—at least, no, it doesn’t do that—” (after going a few\n",
      "yards along the path, and turning several sharp corners), “but I\n",
      "suppose it will at last. But how curiously it twists! It’s more like a\n",
      "corkscrew than a path! Well, _this_ turn goes to the hill, I\n",
      "suppose—no, it doesn’t! This goes straight back to the house! Well\n",
      "then, I’ll try it the other way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And so she did: wandering up and down, and trying turn after turn, but\n",
      "always coming back to the house, do what she would. Indeed, once, when\n",
      "she turned a corner rather more quickly than usual, she ran against it\n",
      "before she could stop herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s no use talking about it,” Alice said, looking up at the house and\n",
      "pretending it was arguing with her. “I’m _not_ going in again yet. I\n",
      "know I should have to get through the Looking-glass again—back into the\n",
      "old room—and there’d be an end of all my adventures!”\n",
      "\n",
      "So, resolutely turning her back upon the house, she set out once more\n",
      "down the path, determined to keep straight on till she got to the hill.\n",
      "For a few minutes all went on well, and she was just saying, “I really\n",
      "_shall_ do it this time—” when the path gave a sudden twist and shook\n",
      "itself (as she described it afterwards), and the next moment she found\n",
      "herself actually walking in at the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, it’s too bad!” she cried. “I never saw such a house for getting in\n",
      "the way! Never!”\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there was the hill full in sight, so there was nothing to be\n",
      "done but start again. This time she came upon a large flower-bed, with\n",
      "a border of daisies, and a willow-tree growing in the middle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“O Tiger-lily,” said Alice, addressing herself to one that was waving\n",
      "gracefully about in the wind, “I _wish_ you could talk!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We _can_ talk,” said the Tiger-lily: “when there’s anybody worth\n",
      "talking to.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was so astonished that she could not speak for a minute: it quite\n",
      "seemed to take her breath away. At length, as the Tiger-lily only went\n",
      "on waving about, she spoke again, in a timid voice—almost in a whisper.\n",
      "“And can _all_ the flowers talk?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“As well as _you_ can,” said the Tiger-lily. “And a great deal louder.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It isn’t manners for us to begin, you know,” said the Rose, “and I\n",
      "really was wondering when you’d speak! Said I to myself, ‘Her face has\n",
      "got _some_ sense in it, though it’s not a clever one!’ Still, you’re\n",
      "the right colour, and that goes a long way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t care about the colour,” the Tiger-lily remarked. “If only her\n",
      "petals curled up a little more, she’d be all right.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice didn’t like being criticised, so she began asking questions.\n",
      "“Aren’t you sometimes frightened at being planted out here, with nobody\n",
      "to take care of you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s the tree in the middle,” said the Rose: “what else is it good\n",
      "for?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But what could it do, if any danger came?” Alice asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It says ‘Bough-wough!’” cried a Daisy: “that’s why its branches are\n",
      "called boughs!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Didn’t you know _that_?” cried another Daisy, and here they all began\n",
      "shouting together, till the air seemed quite full of little shrill\n",
      "voices. “Silence, every one of you!” cried the Tiger-lily, waving\n",
      "itself passionately from side to side, and trembling with excitement.\n",
      "“They know I can’t get at them!” it panted, bending its quivering head\n",
      "towards Alice, “or they wouldn’t dare to do it!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never mind!” Alice said in a soothing tone, and stooping down to the\n",
      "daisies, who were just beginning again, she whispered, “If you don’t\n",
      "hold your tongues, I’ll pick you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was silence in a moment, and several of the pink daisies turned\n",
      "white.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s right!” said the Tiger-lily. “The daisies are worst of all.\n",
      "When one speaks, they all begin together, and it’s enough to make one\n",
      "wither to hear the way they go on!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How is it you can all talk so nicely?” Alice said, hoping to get it\n",
      "into a better temper by a compliment. “I’ve been in many gardens\n",
      "before, but none of the flowers could talk.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Put your hand down, and feel the ground,” said the Tiger-lily. “Then\n",
      "you’ll know why.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice did so. “It’s very hard,” she said, “but I don’t see what that\n",
      "has to do with it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In most gardens,” the Tiger-lily said, “they make the beds too soft—so\n",
      "that the flowers are always asleep.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This sounded a very good reason, and Alice was quite pleased to know\n",
      "it. “I never thought of that before!” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s _my_ opinion that you never think _at all_,” the Rose said in a\n",
      "rather severe tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I never saw anybody that looked stupider,” a Violet said, so suddenly,\n",
      "that Alice quite jumped; for it hadn’t spoken before.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hold _your_ tongue!” cried the Tiger-lily. “As if _you_ ever saw\n",
      "anybody! You keep your head under the leaves, and snore away there,\n",
      "till you know no more what’s going on in the world, than if you were a\n",
      "bud!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are there any more people in the garden besides me?” Alice said, not\n",
      "choosing to notice the Rose’s last remark.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s one other flower in the garden that can move about like you,”\n",
      "said the Rose. “I wonder how you do it—” (“You’re always wondering,”\n",
      "said the Tiger-lily), “but she’s more bushy than you are.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is she like me?” Alice asked eagerly, for the thought crossed her\n",
      "mind, “There’s another little girl in the garden, somewhere!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, she has the same awkward shape as you,” the Rose said, “but\n",
      "she’s redder—and her petals are shorter, I think.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Her petals are done up close, almost like a dahlia,” the Tiger-lily\n",
      "interrupted: “not tumbled about anyhow, like yours.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But that’s not _your_ fault,” the Rose added kindly: “you’re beginning\n",
      "to fade, you know—and then one can’t help one’s petals getting a little\n",
      "untidy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice didn’t like this idea at all: so, to change the subject, she\n",
      "asked “Does she ever come out here?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I daresay you’ll see her soon,” said the Rose. “She’s one of the\n",
      "thorny kind.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where does she wear the thorns?” Alice asked with some curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why all round her head, of course,” the Rose replied. “I was wondering\n",
      "_you_ hadn’t got some too. I thought it was the regular rule.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She’s coming!” cried the Larkspur. “I hear her footstep, thump, thump,\n",
      "thump, along the gravel-walk!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice looked round eagerly, and found that it was the Red Queen. “She’s\n",
      "grown a good deal!” was her first remark. She had indeed: when Alice\n",
      "first found her in the ashes, she had been only three inches high—and\n",
      "here she was, half a head taller than Alice herself!\n",
      "\n",

      "it is, out here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think I’ll go and meet her,” said Alice, for, though the flowers\n",

      "\n",
      "A little provoked, she drew back, and after looking everywhere for the\n",

      "\n",
      "“Where do you come from?” said the Red Queen. “And where are you going?\n",
      "Look up, speak nicely, and don’t twiddle your fingers all the time.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“I don’t know what you mean by _your_ way,” said the Queen: “all the\n",
      "ways about here belong to _me_—but why did you come out here at all?”\n",
      "she added in a kinder tone. “Curtsey while you’re thinking what to say,\n",

      "herself, “the next time I’m a little late for dinner.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s time for you to answer now,” the Queen said, looking at her\n",
      "watch: “open your mouth a _little_ wider when you speak, and always say\n",
      "‘your Majesty.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I only wanted to see what the garden was like, your Majesty—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s right,” said the Queen, patting her on the head, which Alice\n",

      "gardens, compared with which this would be a wilderness.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice didn’t dare to argue the point, but went on: “—and I thought I’d\n",
      "try and find my way to the top of that hill—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“When you say ‘hill,’” the Queen interrupted, “_I_ could show you\n",
      "hills, in comparison with which you’d call that a valley.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, I shouldn’t,” said Alice, surprised into contradicting her at\n",
      "last: “a hill _can’t_ be a valley, you know. That would be nonsense—”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Red Queen shook her head, “You may call it ‘nonsense’ if you like,”\n",
      "she said, “but _I’ve_ heard nonsense, compared with which that would be\n",
      "as sensible as a dictionary!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice curtseyed again, as she was afraid from the Queen’s tone that she\n",
      "was a _little_ offended: and they walked on in silence till they got to\n",
      "the top of the little hill.\n",
      "\n",
      "For some minutes Alice stood without speaking, looking out in all\n",
      "directions over the country—and a most curious country it was. There\n",
      "were a number of tiny little brooks running straight across it from\n",
      "side to side, and the ground between was divided up into squares by a\n",
      "number of little green hedges, that reached from brook to brook.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I declare it’s marked out just like a large chessboard!” Alice said at\n",
      "last. “There ought to be some men moving about somewhere—and so there\n",
      "are!” She added in a tone of delight, and her heart began to beat quick\n",
      "with excitement as she went on. “It’s a great huge game of chess that’s\n",
      "being played—all over the world—if this _is_ the world at all, you\n",
      "know. Oh, what fun it is! How I _wish_ I was one of them! I wouldn’t\n",
      "mind being a Pawn, if only I might join—though of course I should\n",
      "_like_ to be a Queen, best.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She glanced rather shyly at the real Queen as she said this, but her\n",
      "companion only smiled pleasantly, and said, “That’s easily managed. You\n",
      "can be the White Queen’s Pawn, if you like, as Lily’s too young to\n",
      "play; and you’re in the Second Square to begin with: when you get to\n",
      "the Eighth Square you’ll be a Queen—” Just at this moment, somehow or\n",
      "other, they began to run.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice never could quite make out, in thinking it over afterwards, how\n",
      "it was that they began: all she remembers is, that they were running\n",
      "hand in hand, and the Queen went so fast that it was all she could do\n",
      "to keep up with her: and still the Queen kept crying “Faster! Faster!”\n",
      "but Alice felt she _could not_ go faster, though she had not breath\n",
      "left to say so.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most curious part of the thing was, that the trees and the other\n",
      "things round them never changed their places at all: however fast they\n",
      "went, they never seemed to pass anything. “I wonder if all the things\n",
      "move along with us?” thought poor puzzled Alice. And the Queen seemed\n",
      "to guess her thoughts, for she cried, “Faster! Don’t try to talk!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Not that Alice had any idea of doing _that_. She felt as if she would\n",
      "never be able to talk again, she was getting so much out of breath: and\n",
      "still the Queen cried “Faster! Faster!” and dragged her along. “Are we\n",
      "nearly there?” Alice managed to pant out at last.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nearly there!” the Queen repeated. “Why, we passed it ten minutes ago!\n",
      "Faster!” And they ran on for a time in silence, with the wind whistling\n",
      "in Alice’s ears, and almost blowing her hair off her head, she fancied.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now! Now!” cried the Queen. “Faster! Faster!” And they went so fast\n",
      "that at last they seemed to skim through the air, hardly touching the\n",
      "ground with their feet, till suddenly, just as Alice was getting quite\n",
      "exhausted, they stopped, and she found herself sitting on the ground,\n",
      "breathless and giddy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Queen propped her up against a tree, and said kindly, “You may rest\n",
      "a little now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice looked round her in great surprise. “Why, I do believe we’ve been\n",
      "under this tree the whole time! Everything’s just as it was!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course it is,” said the Queen, “what would you have it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, in _our_ country,” said Alice, still panting a little, “you’d\n",
      "generally get to somewhere else—if you ran very fast for a long time,\n",
      "as we’ve been doing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A slow sort of country!” said the Queen. “Now, _here_, you see, it\n",
      "takes all the running _you_ can do, to keep in the same place. If you\n",
      "want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as\n",
      "that!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’d rather not try, please!” said Alice. “I’m quite content to stay\n",
      "here—only I _am_ so hot and thirsty!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know what _you’d_ like!” the Queen said good-naturedly, taking a\n",
      "little box out of her pocket. “Have a biscuit?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice thought it would not be civil to say “No,” though it wasn’t at\n",
      "all what she wanted. So she took it, and ate it as well as she could:\n",
      "and it was _very_ dry; and she thought she had never been so nearly\n",
      "choked in all her life.\n",
      "\n",
      "“While you’re refreshing yourself,” said the Queen, “I’ll just take the\n",
      "measurements.” And she took a ribbon out of her pocket, marked in\n",
      "inches, and began measuring the ground, and sticking little pegs in\n",
      "here and there.\n",
      "\n",
      "“At the end of two yards,” she said, putting in a peg to mark the\n",
      "distance, “I shall give you your directions—have another biscuit?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, thank you,” said Alice: “one’s _quite_ enough!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thirst quenched, I hope?” said the Queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice did not know what to say to this, but luckily the Queen did not\n",
      "wait for an answer, but went on. “At the end of _three_ yards I shall\n",
      "repeat them—for fear of your forgetting them. At the end of _four_, I\n",
      "shall say good-bye. And at the end of _five_, I shall go!”\n",
      "\n",
      "She had got all the pegs put in by this time, and Alice looked on with\n",
      "great interest as she returned to the tree, and then began slowly\n",
      "walking down the row.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the two-yard peg she faced round, and said, “A pawn goes two squares\n",
      "in its first move, you know. So you’ll go _very_ quickly through the\n",
      "Third Square—by railway, I should think—and you’ll find yourself in the\n",
      "Fourth Square in no time. Well, _that_ square belongs to Tweedledum and\n",
      "Tweedledee—the Fifth is mostly water—the Sixth belongs to Humpty\n",
      "Dumpty—But you make no remark?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I—I didn’t know I had to make one—just then,” Alice faltered out.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You _should_ have said, ‘It’s extremely kind of you to tell me all\n",
      "this’—however, we’ll suppose it said—the Seventh Square is all\n",
      "forest—however, one of the Knights will show you the way—and in the\n",
      "Eighth Square we shall be Queens together, and it’s all feasting and\n",
      "fun!” Alice got up and curtseyed, and sat down again.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the next peg the Queen turned again, and this time she said, “Speak\n",
      "in French when you can’t think of the English for a thing—turn out your\n",
      "toes as you walk—and remember who you are!” She did not wait for Alice\n",
      "to curtsey this time, but walked on quickly to the next peg, where she\n",
      "turned for a moment to say “good-bye,” and then hurried on to the last.\n",
      "\n",
      "How it happened, Alice never knew, but exactly as she came to the last\n",
      "peg, she was gone. Whether she vanished into the air, or whether she\n",
      "ran quickly into the wood (“and she _can_ run very fast!” thought\n",
      "Alice), there was no way of guessing, but she was gone, and Alice began\n",

      "Of course the first thing to do was to make a grand survey of the\n",
      "country she was going to travel through. “It’s something very like\n",
      "learning geography,” thought Alice, as she stood on tiptoe in hopes of\n",
      "being able to see a little further. “Principal rivers—there _are_ none.\n",
      "Principal mountains—I’m on the only one, but I don’t think it’s got any\n",
      "name. Principal towns—why, what _are_ those creatures, making honey\n",
      "down there? They can’t be bees—nobody ever saw bees a mile off, you\n",
      "know—” and for some time she stood silent, watching one of them that\n",
      "was bustling about among the flowers, poking its proboscis into them,\n",
      "“just as if it was a regular bee,” thought Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, this was anything but a regular bee: in fact it was an\n",
      "elephant—as Alice soon found out, though the idea quite took her breath\n",
      "away at first. “And what enormous flowers they must be!” was her next\n",
      "idea. “Something like cottages with the roofs taken off, and stalks put\n",
      "to them—and what quantities of honey they must make! I think I’ll go\n",
      "down and—no, I won’t _just_ yet,” she went on, checking herself just as\n",
      "she was beginning to run down the hill, and trying to find some excuse\n",
      "for turning shy so suddenly. “It’ll never do to go down among them\n",
      "without a good long branch to brush them away—and what fun it’ll be\n",
      "when they ask me how I like my walk. I shall say—‘Oh, I like it well\n",
      "enough—’” (here came the favourite little toss of the head), “‘only it\n",

      "\n",
      "“I think I’ll go down the other way,” she said after a pause: “and\n",
      "perhaps I may visit the elephants later on. Besides, I do so want to\n",
      "get into the Third Square!”\n",
      "\n",
      "So with this excuse she ran down the hill and jumped over the first of\n",

      "off.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It sounds like a horse,” Alice thought to herself. And an extremely\n",
      "small voice, close to her ear, said, “You might make a joke on\n",

      "\n",
      "“Indeed I shan’t!” Alice said rather impatiently. “I don’t belong to\n",

      "you make one yourself?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The little voice sighed deeply: it was _very_ unhappy, evidently, and\n",
      "Alice would have said something pitying to comfort it, “If it would\n",

      "wonderfully small sigh, that she wouldn’t have heard it at all, if it\n",
      "hadn’t come _quite_ close to her ear. The consequence of this was that\n",
      "it tickled her ear very much, and quite took off her thoughts from the\n",
      "unhappiness of the poor little creature.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know you are a friend,” the little voice went on; “a dear friend,\n",

      "\n",
      "“What kind of insect?” Alice inquired a little anxiously. What she\n",

      "\n",
      "“What, then you don’t—” the little voice began, when it was drowned by\n",

      "Alice among the rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Horse, who had put his head out of the window, quietly drew it in\n",

      "trains jumping at all. “However, it’ll take us into the Fourth Square,\n",
      "that’s some comfort!” she said to herself. In another moment she felt\n",
      "the carriage rise straight up into the air, and in her fright she\n",
      "caught at the thing nearest to her hand, which happened to be the\n",

      "rather afraid of them—at least the large kinds. But I can tell you the\n",
      "names of some of them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course they answer to their names?” the Gnat remarked carelessly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I never knew them to do it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What’s the use of their having names,” the Gnat said, “if they won’t\n",
      "answer to them?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No use to _them_,” said Alice; “but it’s useful to the people who name\n",
      "them, I suppose. If not, why do things have names at all?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can’t say,” the Gnat replied. “Further on, in the wood down there,\n",
      "they’ve got no names—however, go on with your list of insects: you’re\n",
      "wasting time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, there’s the Horse-fly,” Alice began, counting off the names on\n",
      "her fingers.\n",
      "\n",
      "“All right,” said the Gnat: “half way up that bush, you’ll see a\n",
      "Rocking-horse-fly, if you look. It’s made entirely of wood, and gets\n",
      "about by swinging itself from branch to branch.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What does it live on?” Alice asked, with great curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sap and sawdust,” said the Gnat. “Go on with the list.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice looked up at the Rocking-horse-fly with great interest, and made\n",
      "up her mind that it must have been just repainted, it looked so bright\n",
      "and sticky; and then she went on.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And there’s the Dragon-fly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look on the branch above your head,” said the Gnat, “and there you’ll\n",
      "find a snap-dragon-fly. Its body is made of plum-pudding, its wings of\n",
      "holly-leaves, and its head is a raisin burning in brandy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And what does it live on?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Frumenty and mince pie,” the Gnat replied; “and it makes its nest in a\n",
      "Christmas box.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And then there’s the Butterfly,” Alice went on, after she had taken a\n",
      "good look at the insect with its head on fire, and had thought to\n",
      "herself, “I wonder if that’s the reason insects are so fond of flying\n",
      "into candles—because they want to turn into Snap-dragon-flies!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Crawling at your feet,” said the Gnat (Alice drew her feet back in\n",
      "some alarm), “you may observe a Bread-and-Butterfly. Its wings are thin\n",
      "slices of Bread-and-butter, its body is a crust, and its head is a lump\n",
      "of sugar.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And what does _it_ live on?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Weak tea with cream in it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A new difficulty came into Alice’s head. “Supposing it couldn’t find\n",
      "any?” she suggested.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then it would die, of course.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But that must happen very often,” Alice remarked thoughtfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It always happens,” said the Gnat.\n",
      "\n",
      "After this, Alice was silent for a minute or two, pondering. The Gnat\n",
      "amused itself meanwhile by humming round and round her head: at last it\n",
      "settled again and remarked, “I suppose you don’t want to lose your\n",
      "name?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, indeed,” Alice said, a little anxiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And yet I don’t know,” the Gnat went on in a careless tone: “only\n",
      "think how convenient it would be if you could manage to go home without\n",
      "it! For instance, if the governess wanted to call you to your lessons,\n",
      "she would call out ‘come here—,’ and there she would have to leave off,\n",
      "because there wouldn’t be any name for her to call, and of course you\n",
      "wouldn’t have to go, you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That would never do, I’m sure,” said Alice: “the governess would never\n",
      "think of excusing me lessons for that. If she couldn’t remember my\n",
      "name, she’d call me ‘Miss!’ as the servants do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, if she said ‘Miss,’ and didn’t say anything more,” the Gnat\n",
      "remarked, “of course you’d miss your lessons. That’s a joke. I wish\n",
      "_you_ had made it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why do you wish _I_ had made it?” Alice asked. “It’s a very bad one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Gnat only sighed deeply, while two large tears came rolling\n",
      "down its cheeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You shouldn’t make jokes,” Alice said, “if it makes you so unhappy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then came another of those melancholy little sighs, and this time the\n",
      "poor Gnat really seemed to have sighed itself away, for, when Alice\n",
      "looked up, there was nothing whatever to be seen on the twig, and, as\n",
      "she was getting quite chilly with sitting still so long, she got up and\n",
      "walked on.\n",
      "\n",
      "She very soon came to an open field, with a wood on the other side of\n",
      "it: it looked much darker than the last wood, and Alice felt a _little_\n",
      "timid about going into it. However, on second thoughts, she made up her\n",
      "mind to go on: “for I certainly won’t go _back_,” she thought to\n",
      "herself, and this was the only way to the Eighth Square.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This must be the wood,” she said thoughtfully to herself, “where\n",
      "things have no names. I wonder what’ll become of _my_ name when I go\n",
      "in? I shouldn’t like to lose it at all—because they’d have to give me\n",
      "another, and it would be almost certain to be an ugly one. But then the\n",
      "fun would be trying to find the creature that had got my old name!\n",
      "That’s just like the advertisements, you know, when people lose\n",
      "dogs—‘_answers to the name of “Dash:” had on a brass collar_’—just\n",
      "fancy calling everything you met ‘Alice,’ till one of them answered!\n",
      "Only they wouldn’t answer at all, if they were wise.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She was rambling on in this way when she reached the wood: it looked\n",
      "very cool and shady. “Well, at any rate it’s a great comfort,” she said\n",
      "as she stepped under the trees, “after being so hot, to get into\n",
      "the—into _what_?” she went on, rather surprised at not being able to\n",
      "think of the word. “I mean to get under the—under the—under _this_, you\n",
      "know!” putting her hand on the trunk of the tree. “What _does_ it call\n",
      "itself, I wonder? I do believe it’s got no name—why, to be sure it\n",
      "hasn’t!”\n",
      "\n",
      "She stood silent for a minute, thinking: then she suddenly began again.\n",
      "“Then it really _has_ happened, after all! And now, who am I? I _will_\n",
      "remember, if I can! I’m determined to do it!” But being determined\n",
      "didn’t help much, and all she could say, after a great deal of\n",
      "puzzling, was, “L, I _know_ it begins with L!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Just then a Fawn came wandering by: it looked at Alice with its large\n",
      "gentle eyes, but didn’t seem at all frightened. “Here then! Here then!”\n",
      "Alice said, as she held out her hand and tried to stroke it; but it\n",
      "only started back a little, and then stood looking at her again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you call yourself?” the Fawn said at last. Such a soft sweet\n",
      "voice it had!\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wish I knew!” thought poor Alice. She answered, rather sadly,\n",
      "“Nothing, just now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Think again,” it said: “that won’t do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice thought, but nothing came of it. “Please, would you tell me what\n",
      "_you_ call yourself?” she said timidly. “I think that might help a\n",
      "little.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll tell you, if you’ll move a little further on,” the Fawn said. “I\n",
      "can’t remember here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So they walked on together though the wood, Alice with her arms clasped\n",
      "lovingly round the soft neck of the Fawn, till they came out into\n",
      "another open field, and here the Fawn gave a sudden bound into the air,\n",
      "and shook itself free from Alice’s arms. “I’m a Fawn!” it cried out in\n",
      "a voice of delight, “and, dear me! you’re a human child!” A sudden look\n",
      "of alarm came into its beautiful brown eyes, and in another moment it\n",
      "had darted away at full speed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice stood looking after it, almost ready to cry with vexation at\n",
      "having lost her dear little fellow-traveller so suddenly. “However, I\n",
      "know my name now.” she said, “that’s _some_ comfort. Alice—Alice—I\n",
      "won’t forget it again. And now, which of these finger-posts ought I to\n",
      "follow, I wonder?”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not a very difficult question to answer, as there was only one\n",
      "road through the wood, and the two finger-posts both pointed along it.\n",
      "“I’ll settle it,” Alice said to herself, “when the road divides and\n",
      "they point different ways.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But this did not seem likely to happen. She went on and on, a long way,\n",
      "but wherever the road divided there were sure to be two finger-posts\n",
      "pointing the same way, one marked “TO TWEEDLEDUM’S HOUSE” and the other\n",
      "“TO THE HOUSE OF TWEEDLEDEE.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do believe,” said Alice at last, “that they live in the same house!\n",
      "I wonder I never thought of that before—But I can’t stay there long.\n",
      "I’ll just call and say ‘how d’you do?’ and ask them the way out of the\n",
      "wood. If I could only get to the Eighth Square before it gets dark!” So\n",
      "she wandered on, talking to herself as she went, till, on turning a\n",
      "sharp corner, she came upon two fat little men, so suddenly that she\n",
      "could not help starting back, but in another moment she recovered\n",
      "herself, feeling sure that they must be.\n",

      "\n",
      "They were standing under a tree, each with an arm round the other’s\n",
      "neck, and Alice knew which was which in a moment, because one of them\n",
      "had “DUM” embroidered on his collar, and the other “DEE.” “I suppose\n",
      "they’ve each got ‘TWEEDLE’ round at the back of the collar,” she said\n",
      "to herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "They stood so still that she quite forgot they were alive, and she was\n",
      "just looking round to see if the word ‘TWEEDLE’ was written at the back\n",
      "of each collar, when she was startled by a voice coming from the one\n",
      "marked “DUM.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you think we’re wax-works,” he said, “you ought to pay, you know.\n",
      "Wax-works weren’t made to be looked at for nothing, nohow!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Contrariwise,” added the one marked “DEE,” “if you think we’re alive,\n",
      "you ought to speak.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m sure I’m very sorry,” was all Alice could say; for the words of\n",
      "the old song kept ringing through her head like the ticking of a clock,\n",
      "and she could hardly help saying them out loud:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tweedledum and Tweedledee\n",
      "    Agreed to have a battle;\n",
      "For Tweedledum said Tweedledee\n",
      "    Had spoiled his nice new rattle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just then flew down a monstrous crow,\n",
      "    As black as a tar-barrel;\n",
      "Which frightened both the heroes so,\n",
      "    They quite forgot their quarrel.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know what you’re thinking about,” said Tweedledum: “but it isn’t so,\n",
      "nohow.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Contrariwise,” continued Tweedledee, “if it was so, it might be; and\n",
      "if it were so, it would be; but as it isn’t, it ain’t. That’s logic.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was thinking,” Alice said very politely, “which is the best way out\n",
      "of this wood: it’s getting so dark. Would you tell me, please?”\n",
      "\n",
      "But the little men only looked at each other and grinned.\n",
      "\n",
      "They looked so exactly like a couple of great schoolboys, that Alice\n",
      "couldn’t help pointing her finger at Tweedledum, and saying “First\n",
      "Boy!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nohow!” Tweedledum cried out briskly, and shut his mouth up again with\n",
      "a snap.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Next Boy!” said Alice, passing on to Tweedledee, though she felt quite\n",
      "certain he would only shout out “Contrariwise!” and so he did.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’ve been wrong!” cried Tweedledum. “The first thing in a visit is\n",
      "to say ‘How d’ye do?’ and shake hands!” And here the two brothers gave\n",
      "each other a hug, and then they held out the two hands that were free,\n",
      "to shake hands with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice did not like shaking hands with either of them first, for fear of\n",
      "hurting the other one’s feelings; so, as the best way out of the\n",
      "difficulty, she took hold of both hands at once: the next moment they\n",
      "were dancing round in a ring. This seemed quite natural (she remembered\n",
      "afterwards), and she was not even surprised to hear music playing: it\n",
      "seemed to come from the tree under which they were dancing, and it was\n",
      "done (as well as she could make it out) by the branches rubbing one\n",
      "across the other, like fiddles and fiddle-sticks.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But it certainly _was_ funny,” (Alice said afterwards, when she was\n",
      "telling her sister the history of all this,) “to find myself singing\n",
      "‘_Here we go round the mulberry bush_.’ I don’t know when I began it,\n",
      "but somehow I felt as if I’d been singing it a long long time!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The other two dancers were fat, and very soon out of breath. “Four\n",
      "times round is enough for one dance,” Tweedledum panted out, and they\n",
      "left off dancing as suddenly as they had begun: the music stopped at\n",
      "the same moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they let go of Alice’s hands, and stood looking at her for a\n",
      "minute: there was a rather awkward pause, as Alice didn’t know how to\n",
      "begin a conversation with people she had just been dancing with. “It\n",
      "would never do to say ‘How d’ye do?’ _now_,” she said to herself: “we\n",
      "seem to have got beyond that, somehow!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hope you’re not much tired?” she said at last.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nohow. And thank you _very_ much for asking,” said Tweedledum.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So _much_ obliged!” added Tweedledee. “You like poetry?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ye-es, pretty well—_some_ poetry,” Alice said doubtfully. “Would you\n",
      "tell me which road leads out of the wood?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What shall I repeat to her?” said Tweedledee, looking round at\n",

      "The Carpenter said nothing but\n",
      "    ‘Cut us another slice:\n",
      "I wish you were not quite so deaf—\n",
      "    I’ve had to ask you twice!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It seems a shame,’ the Walrus said,\n",
      "    ‘To play them such a trick,\n",
      "After we’ve brought them out so far,\n",
      "    And made them trot so quick!’\n",
      "The Carpenter said nothing but\n",
      "    ‘The butter’s spread too thick!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I weep for you,’ the Walrus said.\n",
      "    ‘I deeply sympathize.’\n",
      "With sobs and tears he sorted out\n",
      "    Those of the largest size.\n",
      "Holding his pocket handkerchief\n",
      "    Before his streaming eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘O Oysters,’ said the Carpenter.\n",
      "    ‘You’ve had a pleasant run!\n",
      "Shall we be trotting home again?’\n",
      "    But answer came there none—\n",
      "And that was scarcely odd, because\n",
      "    They’d eaten every one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I like the Walrus best,” said Alice: “because you see he was a\n",
      "_little_ sorry for the poor oysters.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He ate more than the Carpenter, though,” said Tweedledee. “You see he\n",
      "held his handkerchief in front, so that the Carpenter couldn’t count\n",
      "how many he took: contrariwise.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That was mean!” Alice said indignantly. “Then I like the Carpenter\n",
      "best—if he didn’t eat so many as the Walrus.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But he ate as many as he could get,” said Tweedledum.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a puzzler. After a pause, Alice began, “Well! They were _both_\n",
      "very unpleasant characters—” Here she checked herself in some alarm, at\n",
      "hearing something that sounded to her like the puffing of a large\n",
      "steam-engine in the wood near them, though she feared it was more\n",
      "likely to be a wild beast. “Are there any lions or tigers about here?”\n",
      "she asked timidly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s only the Red King snoring,” said Tweedledee.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come and look at him!” the brothers cried, and they each took one of\n",
      "Alice’s hands, and led her up to where the King was sleeping.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Isn’t he a _lovely_ sight?” said Tweedledum.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice couldn’t say honestly that he was. He had a tall red night-cap\n",
      "on, with a tassel, and he was lying crumpled up into a sort of untidy\n",
      "heap, and snoring loud—“fit to snore his head off!” as Tweedledum\n",
      "remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m afraid he’ll catch cold with lying on the damp grass,” said Alice,\n",
      "who was a very thoughtful little girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He’s dreaming now,” said Tweedledee: “and what do you think he’s\n",
      "dreaming about?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice said “Nobody can guess that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, about _you_!” Tweedledee exclaimed, clapping his hands\n",
      "triumphantly. “And if he left off dreaming about you, where do you\n",
      "suppose you’d be?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where I am now, of course,” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not you!” Tweedledee retorted contemptuously. “You’d be nowhere. Why,\n",
      "you’re only a sort of thing in his dream!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If that there King was to wake,” added Tweedledum, “you’d go\n",
      "out—bang!—just like a candle!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shouldn’t!” Alice exclaimed indignantly. “Besides, if _I’m_ only a\n",
      "sort of thing in his dream, what are _you_, I should like to know?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ditto” said Tweedledum.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ditto, ditto” cried Tweedledee.\n",
      "\n",
      "He shouted this so loud that Alice couldn’t help saying, “Hush! You’ll\n",
      "be waking him, I’m afraid, if you make so much noise.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, it no use _your_ talking about waking him,” said Tweedledum,\n",
      "“when you’re only one of the things in his dream. You know very well\n",
      "you’re not real.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I _am_ real!” said Alice and began to cry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You won’t make yourself a bit realler by crying,” Tweedledee remarked:\n",
      "“there’s nothing to cry about.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If I wasn’t real,” Alice said—half-laughing through her tears, it all\n",
      "seemed so ridiculous—“I shouldn’t be able to cry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hope you don’t suppose those are real tears?” Tweedledum interrupted\n",
      "in a tone of great contempt.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know they’re talking nonsense,” Alice thought to herself: “and it’s\n",
      "foolish to cry about it.” So she brushed away her tears, and went on as\n",
      "cheerfully as she could. “At any rate I’d better be getting out of the\n",
      "wood, for really it’s coming on very dark. Do you think it’s going to\n",
      "rain?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Tweedledum spread a large umbrella over himself and his brother, and\n",
      "looked up into it. “No, I don’t think it is,” he said: “at least—not\n",
      "under _here_. Nohow.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But it may rain _outside_?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It may—if it chooses,” said Tweedledee: “we’ve no objection.\n",
      "Contrariwise.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Selfish things!” thought Alice, and she was just going to say\n",
      "“Good-night” and leave them, when Tweedledum sprang out from under the\n",
      "umbrella and seized her by the wrist.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you see _that_?” he said, in a voice choking with passion, and his\n",
      "eyes grew large and yellow all in a moment, as he pointed with a\n",
      "trembling finger at a small white thing lying under the tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s only a rattle,” Alice said, after a careful examination of the\n",
      "little white thing. “Not a rattle-_snake_, you know,” she added\n",
      "hastily, thinking that he was frightened: “only an old rattle—quite old\n",
      "and broken.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I knew it was!” cried Tweedledum, beginning to stamp about wildly and\n",
      "tear his hair. “It’s spoilt, of course!” Here he looked at Tweedledee,\n",
      "who immediately sat down on the ground, and tried to hide himself under\n",
      "the umbrella.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice laid her hand upon his arm, and said in a soothing tone, “You\n",
      "needn’t be so angry about an old rattle.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But it isn’t old!” Tweedledum cried, in a greater fury than ever.\n",
      "“It’s new, I tell you—I bought it yesterday—my nice new RATTLE!” and\n",
      "his voice rose to a perfect scream.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this time Tweedledee was trying his best to fold up the umbrella,\n",
      "with himself in it: which was such an extraordinary thing to do, that\n",
      "it quite took off Alice’s attention from the angry brother. But he\n",
      "couldn’t quite succeed, and it ended in his rolling over, bundled up in\n",
      "the umbrella, with only his head out: and there he lay, opening and\n",
      "shutting his mouth and his large eyes—“looking more like a fish than\n",
      "anything else,” Alice thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course you agree to have a battle?” Tweedledum said in a calmer\n",
      "tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I suppose so,” the other sulkily replied, as he crawled out of the\n",
      "umbrella: “only _she_ must help us to dress up, you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So the two brothers went off hand-in-hand into the wood, and returned\n",
      "in a minute with their arms full of things—such as bolsters, blankets,\n",
      "hearth-rugs, table-cloths, dish-covers and coal-scuttles. “I hope\n",
      "you’re a good hand at pinning and tying strings?” Tweedledum remarked.\n",
      "“Every one of these things has got to go on, somehow or other.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice said afterwards she had never seen such a fuss made about\n",
      "anything in all her life—the way those two bustled about—and the\n",
      "quantity of things they put on—and the trouble they gave her in tying\n",
      "strings and fastening buttons—“Really they’ll be more like bundles of\n",
      "old clothes than anything else, by the time they’re ready!” she said to\n",
      "herself, as she arranged a bolster round the neck of Tweedledee, “to\n",
      "keep his head from being cut off,” as he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You know,” he added very gravely, “it’s one of the most serious things\n",
      "that can possibly happen to one in a battle—to get one’s head cut off.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice laughed aloud: but she managed to turn it into a cough, for fear\n",
      "of hurting his feelings.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do I look very pale?” said Tweedledum, coming up to have his helmet\n",
      "tied on. (He _called_ it a helmet, though it certainly looked much more\n",
      "like a saucepan.)\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well—yes—a _little_,” Alice replied gently.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m very brave generally,” he went on in a low voice: “only to-day I\n",
      "happen to have a headache.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And _I’ve_ got a toothache!” said Tweedledee, who had overheard the\n",
      "remark. “I’m far worse off than you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then you’d better not fight to-day,” said Alice, thinking it a good\n",
      "opportunity to make peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We _must_ have a bit of a fight, but I don’t care about going on\n",
      "long,” said Tweedledum. “What’s the time now?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Tweedledee looked at his watch, and said “Half-past four.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let’s fight till six, and then have dinner,” said Tweedledum.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very well,” the other said, rather sadly: “and _she_ can watch us—only\n",
      "you’d better not come _very_ close,” he added: “I generally hit\n",
      "everything I can see—when I get really excited.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And _I_ hit everything within reach,” cried Tweedledum, “whether I can\n",
      "see it or not!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice laughed. “You must hit the _trees_ pretty often, I should think,”\n",
      "she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tweedledum looked round him with a satisfied smile. “I don’t suppose,”\n",
      "he said, “there’ll be a tree left standing, for ever so far round, by\n",
      "the time we’ve finished!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And all about a rattle!” said Alice, still hoping to make them a\n",
      "_little_ ashamed of fighting for such a trifle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shouldn’t have minded it so much,” said Tweedledum, “if it hadn’t\n",
      "been a new one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wish the monstrous crow would come!” thought Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s only one sword, you know,” Tweedledum said to his brother:\n",
      "“but you can have the umbrella—it’s quite as sharp. Only we must begin\n",
      "quick. It’s getting as dark as it can.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And darker,” said Tweedledee.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was getting dark so suddenly that Alice thought there must be a\n",
      "thunderstorm coming on. “What a thick black cloud that is!” she said.\n",
      "“And how fast it comes! Why, I do believe it’s got wings!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s the crow!” Tweedledum cried out in a shrill voice of alarm: and\n",
      "the two brothers took to their heels and were out of sight in a moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice ran a little way into the wood, and stopped under a large tree.\n",
      "“It can never get at me _here_,” she thought: “it’s far too large to\n",
      "squeeze itself in among the trees. But I wish it wouldn’t flap its\n",
      "wings so—it makes quite a hurricane in the wood—here’s somebody’s shawl\n",
      "being blown away!”\n",

      "Wool and Water\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She caught the shawl as she spoke, and looked about for the owner: in\n",
      "another moment the White Queen came running wildly through the wood,\n",
      "with both arms stretched out wide, as if she were flying, and Alice\n",
      "very civilly went to meet her with the shawl.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m very glad I happened to be in the way,” Alice said, as she helped\n",
      "her to put on her shawl again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The White Queen only looked at her in a helpless frightened sort of\n",
      "way, and kept repeating something in a whisper to herself that sounded\n",
      "like “bread-and-butter, bread-and-butter,” and Alice felt that if there\n",
      "was to be any conversation at all, she must manage it herself. So she\n",
      "began rather timidly: “Am I addressing the White Queen?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, yes, if you call that a-dressing,” The Queen said. “It isn’t\n",
      "_my_ notion of the thing, at all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice thought it would never do to have an argument at the very\n",
      "beginning of their conversation, so she smiled and said, “If your\n",
      "Majesty will only tell me the right way to begin, I’ll do it as well as\n",
      "I can.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I don’t want it done at all!” groaned the poor Queen. “I’ve been\n",
      "a-dressing myself for the last two hours.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It would have been all the better, as it seemed to Alice, if she had\n",
      "got some one else to dress her, she was so dreadfully untidy. “Every\n",
      "single thing’s crooked,” Alice thought to herself, “and she’s all over\n",
      "pins!—may I put your shawl straight for you?” she added aloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t know what’s the matter with it!” the Queen said, in a\n",
      "melancholy voice. “It’s out of temper, I think. I’ve pinned it here,\n",
      "and I’ve pinned it there, but there’s no pleasing it!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It _can’t_ go straight, you know, if you pin it all on one side,”\n",
      "Alice said, as she gently put it right for her; “and, dear me, what a\n",
      "state your hair is in!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The brush has got entangled in it!” the Queen said with a sigh. “And I\n",
      "lost the comb yesterday.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice carefully released the brush, and did her best to get the hair\n",
      "into order. “Come, you look rather better now!” she said, after\n",
      "altering most of the pins. “But really you should have a lady’s maid!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m sure I’ll take you with pleasure!” the Queen said. “Twopence a\n",
      "week, and jam every other day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice couldn’t help laughing, as she said, “I don’t want you to hire\n",
      "_me_—and I don’t care for jam.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s very good jam,” said the Queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I don’t want any _to-day_, at any rate.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You couldn’t have it if you _did_ want it,” the Queen said. “The rule\n",
      "is, jam to-morrow and jam yesterday—but never jam to-day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It _must_ come sometimes to ‘jam to-day,’” Alice objected.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, it can’t,” said the Queen. “It’s jam every _other_ day: to-day\n",
      "isn’t any _other_ day, you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t understand you,” said Alice. “It’s dreadfully confusing!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s the effect of living backwards,” the Queen said kindly: “it\n",
      "always makes one a little giddy at first—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Living backwards!” Alice repeated in great astonishment. “I never\n",
      "heard of such a thing!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“—but there’s one great advantage in it, that one’s memory works both\n",
      "ways.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m sure _mine_ only works one way,” Alice remarked. “I can’t remember\n",
      "things before they happen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s a poor sort of memory that only works backwards,” the Queen\n",
      "remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What sort of things do _you_ remember best?” Alice ventured to ask.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, things that happened the week after next,” the Queen replied in a\n",
      "careless tone. “For instance, now,” she went on, sticking a large piece\n",
      "of plaster on her finger as she spoke, “there’s the King’s Messenger.\n",
      "He’s in prison now, being punished: and the trial doesn’t even begin\n",
      "till next Wednesday: and of course the crime comes last of all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Suppose he never commits the crime?” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That would be all the better, wouldn’t it?” the Queen said, as she\n",
      "bound the plaster round her finger with a bit of ribbon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice felt there was no denying _that_. “Of course it would be all the\n",
      "better,” she said: “but it wouldn’t be all the better his being\n",
      "punished.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’re wrong _there_, at any rate,” said the Queen: “were _you_ ever\n",
      "punished?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Only for faults,” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And you were all the better for it, I know!” the Queen said\n",
      "triumphantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, but then I _had_ done the things I was punished for,” said Alice:\n",
      "“that makes all the difference.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But if you _hadn’t_ done them,” the Queen said, “that would have been\n",
      "better still; better, and better, and better!” Her voice went higher\n",
      "with each “better,” till it got quite to a squeak at last.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was just beginning to say “There’s a mistake somewhere—,” when\n",
      "the Queen began screaming so loud that she had to leave the sentence\n",
      "unfinished. “Oh, oh, oh!” shouted the Queen, shaking her hand about as\n",
      "if she wanted to shake it off. “My finger’s bleeding! Oh, oh, oh, oh!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Her screams were so exactly like the whistle of a steam-engine, that\n",
      "Alice had to hold both her hands over her ears.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What _is_ the matter?” she said, as soon as there was a chance of\n",
      "making herself heard. “Have you pricked your finger?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I haven’t pricked it _yet_,” the Queen said, “but I soon shall—oh, oh,\n",
      "oh!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“When do you expect to do it?” Alice asked, feeling very much inclined\n",
      "to laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When I fasten my shawl again,” the poor Queen groaned out: “the brooch\n",
      "will come undone directly. Oh, oh!” As she said the words the brooch\n",
      "flew open, and the Queen clutched wildly at it, and tried to clasp it\n",
      "again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Take care!” cried Alice. “You’re holding it all crooked!” And she\n",
      "caught at the brooch; but it was too late: the pin had slipped, and the\n",
      "Queen had pricked her finger.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That accounts for the bleeding, you see,” she said to Alice with a\n",
      "smile. “Now you understand the way things happen here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But why don’t you scream now?” Alice asked, holding her hands ready to\n",
      "put over her ears again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, I’ve done all the screaming already,” said the Queen. “What would\n",
      "be the good of having it all over again?”\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time it was getting light. “The crow must have flown away, I\n",
      "think,” said Alice: “I’m so glad it’s gone. I thought it was the night\n",

      "being glad whenever you like!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Only it is so _very_ lonely here!” Alice said in a melancholy voice;\n",

      "her cheeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, don’t go on like that!” cried the poor Queen, wringing her hands\n",
      "in despair. “Consider what a great girl you are. Consider what a long\n",

      "“Can _you_ keep from crying by considering things?” she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s the way it’s done,” the Queen said with great decision: “nobody\n",
      "can do two things at once, you know. Let’s consider your age to begin\n",
      "with—how old are you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m seven and a half exactly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You needn’t say ‘exactually,’” the Queen remarked: “I can believe it\n",
      "without that. Now I’ll give _you_ something to believe. I’m just one\n",
      "hundred and one, five months and a day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can’t believe _that_!” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",

      "breath, and shut your eyes.”\n",

      "Alice laughed. “There’s no use trying,” she said: “one _can’t_ believe\n",
      "impossible things.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I daresay you haven’t had much practice,” said the Queen. “When I was\n",
      "your age, I always did it for half-an-hour a day. Why, sometimes I’ve\n",
      "believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast. There goes\n",
      "the shawl again!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The brooch had come undone as she spoke, and a sudden gust of wind blew\n",
      "the Queen’s shawl across a little brook. The Queen spread out her arms\n",
      "again, and went flying after it, and this time she succeeded in\n",
      "catching it for herself. “I’ve got it!” she cried in a triumphant tone.\n",
      "“Now you shall see me pin it on again, all by myself!”\n",

      "went on. “Much be-etter! Be-etter! Be-e-e-etter! Be-e-ehh!” The last\n",
      "word ended in a long bleat, so like a sheep that Alice quite started.\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked at the Queen, who seemed to have suddenly wrapped herself up\n",
      "in wool. Alice rubbed her eyes, and looked again. She couldn’t make out\n",
      "what had happened at all. Was she in a shop? And was that really—was it\n",
      "really a _sheep_ that was sitting on the other side of the counter? Rub\n",
      "as she could, she could make nothing more of it: she was in a little\n",
      "dark shop, leaning with her elbows on the counter, and opposite to her\n",
      "was an old Sheep, sitting in an arm-chair knitting, and every now and\n",
      "then leaving off to look at her through a great pair of spectacles.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is it you want to buy?” the Sheep said at last, looking up for a\n",
      "moment from her knitting.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t _quite_ know yet,” Alice said, very gently. “I should like to\n",
      "look all round me first, if I might.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You may look in front of you, and on both sides, if you like,” said\n",
      "the Sheep: “but you can’t look _all_ round you—unless you’ve got eyes\n",
      "at the back of your head.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But these, as it happened, Alice had _not_ got: so she contented\n",
      "herself with turning round, looking at the shelves as she came to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The shop seemed to be full of all manner of curious things—but the\n",
      "oddest part of it all was, that whenever she looked hard at any shelf,\n",
      "to make out exactly what it had on it, that particular shelf was always\n",
      "quite empty: though the others round it were crowded as full as they\n",
      "could hold.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Things flow about so here!” she said at last in a plaintive tone,\n",
      "after she had spent a minute or so in vainly pursuing a large bright\n",
      "thing, that looked sometimes like a doll and sometimes like a work-box,\n",
      "and was always in the shelf next above the one she was looking at. “And\n",
      "this one is the most provoking of all—but I’ll tell you what—” she\n",
      "added, as a sudden thought struck her, “I’ll follow it up to the very\n",
      "top shelf of all. It’ll puzzle it to go through the ceiling, I expect!”\n",
      "\n",
      "But even this plan failed: the “thing” went through the ceiling as\n",
      "quietly as possible, as if it were quite used to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you a child or a teetotum?” the Sheep said, as she took up another\n",
      "pair of needles. “You’ll make me giddy soon, if you go on turning round\n",
      "like that.” She was now working with fourteen pairs at once, and Alice\n",
      "couldn’t help looking at her in great astonishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How _can_ she knit with so many?” the puzzled child thought to\n",
      "herself. “She gets more and more like a porcupine every minute!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Can you row?” the Sheep asked, handing her a pair of knitting-needles\n",
      "as she spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, a little—but not on land—and not with needles—” Alice was\n",
      "beginning to say, when suddenly the needles turned into oars in her\n",
      "hands, and she found they were in a little boat, gliding along between\n",
      "banks: so there was nothing for it but to do her best.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Feather!” cried the Sheep, as she took up another pair of needles.\n",
      "\n",
      "This didn’t sound like a remark that needed any answer, so Alice said\n",
      "nothing, but pulled away. There was something very queer about the\n",
      "water, she thought, as every now and then the oars got fast in it, and\n",
      "would hardly come out again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Feather! Feather!” the Sheep cried again, taking more needles. “You’ll\n",
      "be catching a crab directly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A dear little crab!” thought Alice. “I should like that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Didn’t you hear me say ‘Feather’?” the Sheep cried angrily, taking up\n",
      "quite a bunch of needles.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed I did,” said Alice: “you’ve said it very often—and very loud.\n",
      "Please, where _are_ the crabs?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In the water, of course!” said the Sheep, sticking some of the needles\n",
      "into her hair, as her hands were full. “Feather, I say!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_Why_ do you say ‘feather’ so often?” Alice asked at last, rather\n",
      "vexed. “I’m not a bird!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are,” said the Sheep: “you’re a little goose.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This offended Alice a little, so there was no more conversation for a\n",
      "minute or two, while the boat glided gently on, sometimes among beds of\n",
      "weeds (which made the oars stick fast in the water, worse then ever),\n",
      "and sometimes under trees, but always with the same tall river-banks\n",
      "frowning over their heads.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, please! There are some scented rushes!” Alice cried in a sudden\n",
      "transport of delight. “There really are—and _such_ beauties!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You needn’t say ‘please’ to _me_ about “em,” the Sheep said, without\n",
      "looking up from her knitting: “I didn’t put “em there, and I’m not\n",
      "going to take “em away.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, but I meant—please, may we wait and pick some?” Alice pleaded. “If\n",
      "you don’t mind stopping the boat for a minute.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How am _I_ to stop it?” said the Sheep. “If you leave off rowing,\n",
      "it’ll stop of itself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So the boat was left to drift down the stream as it would, till it\n",
      "glided gently in among the waving rushes. And then the little sleeves\n",
      "were carefully rolled up, and the little arms were plunged in\n",
      "elbow-deep to get the rushes a good long way down before breaking them\n",
      "off—and for a while Alice forgot all about the Sheep and the knitting,\n",
      "as she bent over the side of the boat, with just the ends of her\n",
      "tangled hair dipping into the water—while with bright eager eyes she\n",
      "caught at one bunch after another of the darling scented rushes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I only hope the boat won’t tipple over!” she said to herself. “Oh,\n",
      "_what_ a lovely one! Only I couldn’t quite reach it.” “And it certainly\n",
      "_did_ seem a little provoking (“almost as if it happened on purpose,”\n",
      "she thought) that, though she managed to pick plenty of beautiful\n",
      "rushes as the boat glided by, there was always a more lovely one that\n",
      "she couldn’t reach.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The prettiest are always further!” she said at last, with a sigh at\n",
      "the obstinacy of the rushes in growing so far off, as, with flushed\n",
      "cheeks and dripping hair and hands, she scrambled back into her place,\n",
      "and began to arrange her new-found treasures.\n",
      "\n",
      "What mattered it to her just then that the rushes had begun to fade,\n",
      "and to lose all their scent and beauty, from the very moment that she\n",
      "picked them? Even real scented rushes, you know, last only a very\n",
      "little while—and these, being dream-rushes, melted away almost like\n",
      "snow, as they lay in heaps at her feet—but Alice hardly noticed this,\n",
      "there were so many other curious things to think about.\n",
      "\n",
      "They hadn’t gone much farther before the blade of one of the oars got\n",
      "fast in the water and _wouldn’t_ come out again (so Alice explained it\n",
      "afterwards), and the consequence was that the handle of it caught her\n",
      "under the chin, and, in spite of a series of little shrieks of “Oh, oh,\n",
      "oh!” from poor Alice, it swept her straight off the seat, and down\n",
      "among the heap of rushes.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, she wasn’t hurt, and was soon up again: the Sheep went on with\n",
      "her knitting all the while, just as if nothing had happened. “That was\n",
      "a nice crab you caught!” she remarked, as Alice got back into her\n",
      "place, very much relieved to find herself still in the boat.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Was it? I didn’t see it,” Said Alice, peeping cautiously over the side\n",
      "of the boat into the dark water. “I wish it hadn’t let go—I should so\n",
      "like to see a little crab to take home with me!” But the Sheep only\n",
      "laughed scornfully, and went on with her knitting.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are there many crabs here?” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Crabs, and all sorts of things,” said the Sheep: “plenty of choice,\n",
      "only make up your mind. Now, what _do_ you want to buy?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To buy!” Alice echoed in a tone that was half astonished and half\n",
      "frightened—for the oars, and the boat, and the river, had vanished all\n",
      "in a moment, and she was back again in the little dark shop.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should like to buy an egg, please,” she said timidly. “How do you\n",
      "sell them?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fivepence farthing for one—Twopence for two,” the Sheep replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then two are cheaper than one?” Alice said in a surprised tone, taking\n",
      "out her purse.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Only you _must_ eat them both, if you buy two,” said the Sheep.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then I’ll have _one_, please,” said Alice, as she put the money down\n",
      "on the counter. For she thought to herself, “They mightn’t be at all\n",
      "nice, you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Sheep took the money, and put it away in a box: then she said “I\n",
      "never put things into people’s hands—that would never do—you must get\n",
      "it for yourself.” And so saying, she went off to the other end of the\n",
      "shop, and set the egg upright on a shelf.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wonder _why_ it wouldn’t do?” thought Alice, as she groped her way\n",
      "among the tables and chairs, for the shop was very dark towards the\n",
      "end. “The egg seems to get further away the more I walk towards it. Let\n",
      "me see, is this a chair? Why, it’s got branches, I declare! How very\n",
      "odd to find trees growing here! And actually here’s a little brook!\n",

      "It might have been written a hundred times, easily, on that enormous\n",

      "“Don’t stand there chattering to yourself like that,” Humpty Dumpty\n",
      "said, looking at her for the first time, “but tell me your name and\n",
      "your business.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My _name_ is Alice, but—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s a stupid enough name!” Humpty Dumpty interrupted impatiently.\n",
      "“What does it mean?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_Must_ a name mean something?” Alice asked doubtfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course it must,” Humpty Dumpty said with a short laugh: “_my_ name\n",
      "means the shape I am—and a good handsome shape it is, too. With a name\n",
      "like yours, you might be any shape, almost.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“Why, because there’s nobody with me!” cried Humpty Dumpty. “Did you\n",
      "think I didn’t know the answer to _that_? Ask another.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t you think you’d be safer down on the ground?” Alice went on, not\n",
      "with any idea of making another riddle, but simply in her good-natured\n",
      "anxiety for the queer creature. “That wall is so _very_ narrow!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What tremendously easy riddles you ask!” Humpty Dumpty growled out.\n",
      "“Of course I don’t think so! Why, if ever I _did_ fall off—which\n",
      "there’s no chance of—but _if_ I did—” Here he pursed his lips and\n",
      "looked so solemn and grand that Alice could hardly help laughing. “_If_\n",

      "mouth_—to—to—”\n",

      "unwisely.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now I declare that’s too bad!” Humpty Dumpty cried, breaking into a\n",
      "sudden passion. “You’ve been listening at doors—and behind trees—and\n",
      "down chimneys—or you couldn’t have known it!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I haven’t, indeed!” Alice said very gently. “It’s in a book.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, well! They may write such things in a _book_,” Humpty Dumpty said\n",
      "in a calmer tone. “That’s what you call a History of England, that is.\n",
      "Now, take a good look at me! I’m one that has spoken to a King, _I_ am:\n",
      "mayhap you’ll never see such another: and to show you I’m not proud,\n",
      "you may shake hands with me!” And he grinned almost from ear to ear, as\n",
      "he leant forwards (and as nearly as possible fell off the wall in doing\n",
      "so) and offered Alice his hand. She watched him a little anxiously as\n",
      "she took it. “If he smiled much more, the ends of his mouth might meet\n",
      "behind,” she thought: “and then I don’t know what would happen to his\n",
      "head! I’m afraid it would come off!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, all his horses and all his men,” Humpty Dumpty went on. “They’d\n",
      "pick me up again in a minute, _they_ would! However, this conversation\n",
      "is going on a little too fast: let’s go back to the last remark but\n",
      "one.”\n",

      "“I’m afraid I can’t quite remember it,” Alice said very politely.\n",

      "choose a subject—” (“He talks about it just as if it was a game!”\n",
      "thought Alice.) “So here’s a question for you. How old did you say you\n",
      "were?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice made a short calculation, and said “Seven years and six months.”\n",

      "uncomfortable sort of age. Now if you’d asked _my_ advice, I’d have\n",
      "said ‘Leave off at seven’—but it’s too late now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I never ask advice about growing,” Alice said indignantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Too proud?” the other inquired.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice felt even more indignant at this suggestion. “I mean,” she said,\n",
      "“that one can’t help growing older.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_One_ can’t, perhaps,” said Humpty Dumpty, “but _two_ can. With proper\n",
      "assistance, you might have left off at seven.”\n",

      "(They had had quite enough of the subject of age, she thought: and if\n",
      "they really were to take turns in choosing subjects, it was her turn\n",
      "now.) “At least,” she corrected herself on second thoughts, “a\n",
      "beautiful cravat, I should have said—no, a belt, I mean—I beg your\n",
      "pardon!” she added in dismay, for Humpty Dumpty looked thoroughly\n",
      "offended, and she began to wish she hadn’t chosen that subject. “If I\n",
      "only knew,” she thought to herself, “which was neck and which was\n",
      "waist!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Evidently Humpty Dumpty was very angry, though he said nothing for a\n",
      "minute or two. When he _did_ speak again, it was in a deep growl.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is a—_most—provoking_—thing,” he said at last, “when a person\n",
      "doesn’t know a cravat from a belt!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know it’s very ignorant of me,” Alice said, in so humble a tone that\n",
      "Humpty Dumpty relented.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s a cravat, child, and a beautiful one, as you say. It’s a present\n",
      "from the White King and Queen. There now!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is it really?” said Alice, quite pleased to find that she _had_ chosen\n",
      "a good subject, after all.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They gave it me,” Humpty Dumpty continued thoughtfully, as he crossed\n",
      "one knee over the other and clasped his hands round it, “they gave it\n",
      "me—for an un-birthday present.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I beg your pardon?” Alice said with a puzzled air.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m not offended,” said Humpty Dumpty.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I mean, what _is_ an un-birthday present?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A present given when it isn’t your birthday, of course.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice considered a little. “I like birthday presents best,” she said at\n",
      "last.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You don’t know what you’re talking about!” cried Humpty Dumpty. “How\n",
      "many days are there in a year?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Three hundred and sixty-five,” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“One.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Three hundred and sixty-four, of course.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Humpty Dumpty looked doubtful. “I’d rather see that done on paper,” he\n",
      "said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice couldn’t help smiling as she took out her memorandum-book, and\n",

      "\n",
      "“You’re holding it upside down!” Alice interrupted.\n",
      "\n",
      "“To be sure I was!” Humpty Dumpty said gaily, as she turned it round\n",
      "for him. “I thought it looked a little queer. As I was saying, that\n",
      "_seems_ to be done right—though I haven’t time to look it over\n",
      "thoroughly just now—and that shows that there are three hundred and\n",
      "sixty-four days when you might get un-birthday presents—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Certainly,” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",

      "you!”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Humpty Dumpty smiled contemptuously. “Of course you don’t—till I tell\n",
      "you. I meant ‘there’s a nice knock-down argument for you!’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But ‘glory’ doesn’t mean ‘a nice knock-down argument,’” Alice\n",
      "objected.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When _I_ use a word,” Humpty Dumpty said in rather a scornful tone,\n",
      "“it means just what I choose it to mean—neither more nor less.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The question is,” said Alice, “whether you _can_ make words mean so\n",
      "many different things.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The question is,” said Humpty Dumpty, “which is to be master—that’s\n",
      "all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was too much puzzled to say anything, so after a minute Humpty\n",
      "Dumpty began again. “They’ve a temper, some of them—particularly verbs,\n",
      "they’re the proudest—adjectives you can do anything with, but not\n",
      "verbs—however, _I_ can manage the whole lot of them! Impenetrability!\n",
      "That’s what _I_ say!”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Now you talk like a reasonable child,” said Humpty Dumpty, looking\n",
      "very much pleased. “I meant by ‘impenetrability’ that we’ve had enough\n",
      "of that subject, and it would be just as well if you’d mention what you\n",
      "mean to do next, as I suppose you don’t mean to stop here all the rest\n",
      "of your life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s a great deal to make one word mean,” Alice said in a thoughtful\n",
      "tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When I make a word do a lot of work like that,” said Humpty Dumpty, “I\n",
      "always pay it extra.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh!” said Alice. She was too much puzzled to make any other remark.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, you should see “em come round me of a Saturday night,” Humpty\n",
      "Dumpty went on, wagging his head gravely from side to side: “for to get\n",
      "their wages, you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "(Alice didn’t venture to ask what he paid them with; and so you see I\n",
      "can’t tell _you_.)\n",
      "\n",
      "“You seem very clever at explaining words, Sir,” said Alice. “Would you\n",
      "kindly tell me the meaning of the poem called ‘Jabberwocky’?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let’s hear it,” said Humpty Dumpty. “I can explain all the poems that\n",
      "were ever invented—and a good many that haven’t been invented just\n",
      "yet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This sounded very hopeful, so Alice repeated the first verse:\n",
      "\n",
      "’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves\n",
      "    Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;\n",
      "All mimsy were the borogoves,\n",
      "    And the mome raths outgrabe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s enough to begin with,” Humpty Dumpty interrupted: “there are\n",
      "plenty of hard words there. ‘_Brillig_’ means four o’clock in the\n",
      "afternoon—the time when you begin _broiling_ things for dinner.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’ll do very well,” said Alice: “and ‘_slithy_’?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, ‘_slithy_’ means ‘lithe and slimy.’ ‘Lithe’ is the same as\n",
      "‘active.’ You see it’s like a portmanteau—there are two meanings packed\n",
      "up into one word.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I see it now,” Alice remarked thoughtfully: “and what are ‘_toves_’?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, ‘_toves_’ are something like badgers—they’re something like\n",
      "lizards—and they’re something like corkscrews.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They must be very curious looking creatures.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They are that,” said Humpty Dumpty: “also they make their nests under\n",
      "sun-dials—also they live on cheese.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And what’s the ‘_gyre_’ and to ‘_gimble_’?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To ‘_gyre_’ is to go round and round like a gyroscope. To ‘_gimble_’\n",
      "is to make holes like a gimlet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And ‘_the wabe_’ is the grass-plot round a sun-dial, I suppose?” said\n",
      "Alice, surprised at her own ingenuity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course it is. It’s called ‘_wabe_,’ you know, because it goes a\n",
      "long way before it, and a long way behind it—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And a long way beyond it on each side,” Alice added.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Exactly so. Well, then, ‘_mimsy_’ is ‘flimsy and miserable’ (there’s\n",
      "another portmanteau for you). And a ‘_borogove_’ is a thin\n",
      "shabby-looking bird with its feathers sticking out all round—something\n",
      "like a live mop.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And then ‘_mome raths_’?” said Alice. “I’m afraid I’m giving you a\n",
      "great deal of trouble.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, a ‘_rath_’ is a sort of green pig: but ‘_mome_’ I’m not certain\n",
      "about. I think it’s short for ‘from home’—meaning that they’d lost\n",
      "their way, you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And what does ‘_outgrabe_’ mean?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, ‘_outgrabing_’ is something between bellowing and whistling,\n",
      "with a kind of sneeze in the middle: however, you’ll hear it done,\n",
      "maybe—down in the wood yonder—and when you’ve once heard it you’ll be\n",
      "_quite_ content. Who’s been repeating all that hard stuff to you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I read it in a book,” said Alice. “But I had some poetry repeated to\n",
      "me, much easier than that, by—Tweedledee, I think it was.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“As to poetry, you know,” said Humpty Dumpty, stretching out one of his\n",
      "great hands, “_I_ can repeat poetry as well as other folk, if it comes\n",
      "to that—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, it needn’t come to that!” Alice hastily said, hoping to keep him\n",
      "from beginning.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The piece I’m going to repeat,” he went on without noticing her\n",
      "remark, “was written entirely for your amusement.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice felt that in that case she really _ought_ to listen to it, so she\n",
      "sat down, and said “Thank you” rather sadly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In winter, when the fields are white,\n",
      "I sing this song for your delight—\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "“I see you don’t,” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you can _see_ whether I’m singing or not, you’ve sharper eyes than\n",

      "Take pen and ink, and write it down.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“You needn’t go on making remarks like that,” Humpty Dumpty said:\n",
      "“they’re not sensible, and they put me out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I sent a message to the fish:\n",
      "I told them ‘This is what I wish.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The little fishes of the sea,\n",
      "They sent an answer back to me.\n",

      "‘We cannot do it, Sir, because—‘”\n",

      "‘Why, what a temper you are in!’\n",

      "\n",
      "This was rather sudden, Alice thought: but, after such a _very_ strong\n",
      "hint that she ought to be going, she felt that it would hardly be civil\n",
      "to stay. So she got up, and held out her hand. “Good-bye, till we meet\n",
      "again!” she said as cheerfully as she could.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shouldn’t know you again if we _did_ meet,” Humpty Dumpty replied in\n",

      "“That’s just what I complain of,” said Humpty Dumpty. “Your face is the\n",
      "same as everybody has—the two eyes, so—” (marking their places in the\n",
      "air with this thumb) “nose in the middle, mouth under. It’s always the\n",
      "same. Now if you had the two eyes on the same side of the nose, for\n",
      "instance—or the mouth at the top—that would be _some_ help.”\n",

      "Alice waited a minute to see if he would speak again, but as he never\n",
      "opened his eyes or took any further notice of her, she said “Good-bye!”\n",
      "once more, and, getting no answer to this, she quietly walked away: but\n",
      "she couldn’t help saying to herself as she went, “Of all the\n",
      "unsatisfactory—” (she repeated this aloud, as it was a great comfort to\n",
      "have such a long word to say) “of all the unsatisfactory people I\n",

      "The next moment soldiers came running through the wood, at first in\n",
      "twos and threes, then ten or twenty together, and at last in such\n",
      "crowds that they seemed to fill the whole forest. Alice got behind a\n",
      "tree, for fear of being run over, and watched them go by.\n",
      "\n",
      "She thought that in all her life she had never seen soldiers so\n",
      "uncertain on their feet: they were always tripping over something or\n",

      "so that the ground was soon covered with little heaps of men.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then came the horses. Having four feet, these managed rather better\n",
      "than the foot-soldiers: but even _they_ stumbled now and then; and it\n",

      "very glad to get out of the wood into an open place, where she found\n",

      "memorandum-book.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve sent them all!” the King cried in a tone of delight, on seeing\n",

      "through the wood?”\n",

      "\n",
      "“Not at all,” said the King. “He’s an Anglo-Saxon Messenger—and those\n",

      "“It isn’t respectable to beg,” said the King.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I only meant that I didn’t understand,” said Alice. “Why one to come\n",
      "and one to go?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Didn’t I tell you?” the King repeated impatiently. “I must have\n",
      "_two_—to fetch and carry. One to fetch, and one to carry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment the Messenger arrived: he was far too much out of breath\n",
      "to say a word, and could only wave his hands about, and make the most\n",
      "fearful faces at the poor King.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This young lady loves you with an H,” the King said, introducing Alice\n",
      "in the hope of turning off the Messenger’s attention from himself—but\n",
      "it was no use—the Anglo-Saxon attitudes only got more extraordinary\n",
      "every moment, while the great eyes rolled wildly from side to side.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You alarm me!” said the King. “I feel faint—Give me a ham sandwich!”\n",
      "\n",
      "On which the Messenger, to Alice’s great amusement, opened a bag that\n",
      "hung round his neck, and handed a sandwich to the King, who devoured it\n",
      "greedily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Another sandwich!” said the King.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s nothing but hay left now,” the Messenger said, peeping into\n",
      "the bag.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hay, then,” the King murmured in a faint whisper.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was glad to see that it revived him a good deal. “There’s nothing\n",
      "like eating hay when you’re faint,” he remarked to her, as he munched\n",
      "away.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should think throwing cold water over you would be better,” Alice\n",
      "suggested: “or some sal-volatile.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I didn’t say there was nothing _better_,” the King replied. “I said\n",
      "there was nothing _like_ it.” Which Alice did not venture to deny.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who did you pass on the road?” the King went on, holding out his hand\n",
      "to the Messenger for some more hay.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nobody,” said the Messenger.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Quite right,” said the King: “this young lady saw him too. So of\n",
      "course Nobody walks slower than you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do my best,” the Messenger said in a sulky tone. “I’m sure nobody\n",
      "walks much faster than I do!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He can’t do that,” said the King, “or else he’d have been here first.\n",
      "However, now you’ve got your breath, you may tell us what’s happened in\n",
      "the town.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll whisper it,” said the Messenger, putting his hands to his mouth\n",
      "in the shape of a trumpet, and stooping so as to get close to the\n",
      "King’s ear. Alice was sorry for this, as she wanted to hear the news\n",
      "too. However, instead of whispering, he simply shouted at the top of\n",
      "his voice “They’re at it again!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you call _that_ a whisper?” cried the poor King, jumping up and\n",
      "shaking himself. “If you do such a thing again, I’ll have you buttered!\n",
      "It went through and through my head like an earthquake!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It would have to be a very tiny earthquake!” thought Alice. “Who are\n",
      "at it again?” she ventured to ask.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why the Lion and the Unicorn, of course,” said the King.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fighting for the crown?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, to be sure,” said the King: “and the best of the joke is, that\n",
      "it’s _my_ crown all the while! Let’s run and see them.” And they\n",
      "trotted off, Alice repeating to herself, as she ran, the words of the\n",
      "old song:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“The Lion and the Unicorn were fighting for the crown:\n",
      "The Lion beat the Unicorn all round the town.\n",
      "Some gave them white bread, some gave them brown;\n",
      "Some gave them plum-cake and drummed them out of town.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Does—the one—that wins—get the crown?” she asked, as well as she\n",
      "could, for the run was putting her quite out of breath.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dear me, no!” said the King. “What an idea!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Would you—be good enough,” Alice panted out, after running a little\n",
      "further, “to stop a minute—just to get—one’s breath again?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m _good_ enough,” the King said, “only I’m not strong enough. You\n",
      "see, a minute goes by so fearfully quick. You might as well try to stop\n",
      "a Bandersnatch!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice had no more breath for talking, so they trotted on in silence,\n",
      "till they came in sight of a great crowd, in the middle of which the\n",
      "Lion and Unicorn were fighting. They were in such a cloud of dust, that\n",
      "at first Alice could not make out which was which: but she soon managed\n",
      "to distinguish the Unicorn by his horn.\n",
      "\n",
      "They placed themselves close to where Hatta, the other messenger, was\n",
      "standing watching the fight, with a cup of tea in one hand and a piece\n",
      "of bread-and-butter in the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He’s only just out of prison, and he hadn’t finished his tea when he\n",
      "was sent in,” Haigha whispered to Alice: “and they only give them\n",
      "oyster-shells in there—so you see he’s very hungry and thirsty. How are\n",
      "you, dear child?” he went on, putting his arm affectionately round\n",
      "Hatta’s neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hatta looked round and nodded, and went on with his bread and butter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Were you happy in prison, dear child?” said Haigha.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hatta looked round once more, and this time a tear or two trickled down\n",
      "his cheek: but not a word would he say.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Speak, can’t you!” Haigha cried impatiently. But Hatta only munched\n",
      "away, and drank some more tea.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Speak, won’t you!” cried the King. “How are they getting on with the\n",
      "fight?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Hatta made a desperate effort, and swallowed a large piece of\n",
      "bread-and-butter. “They’re getting on very well,” he said in a choking\n",
      "voice: “each of them has been down about eighty-seven times.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then I suppose they’ll soon bring the white bread and the brown?”\n",
      "Alice ventured to remark.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s waiting for “em now,” said Hatta: “this is a bit of it as I’m\n",
      "eating.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a pause in the fight just then, and the Lion and the Unicorn\n",
      "sat down, panting, while the King called out “Ten minutes allowed for\n",
      "refreshments!” Haigha and Hatta set to work at once, carrying rough\n",
      "trays of white and brown bread. Alice took a piece to taste, but it was\n",
      "_very_ dry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t think they’ll fight any more to-day,” the King said to Hatta:\n",
      "“go and order the drums to begin.” And Hatta went bounding away like a\n",
      "grasshopper.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a minute or two Alice stood silent, watching him. Suddenly she\n",
      "brightened up. “Look, look!” she cried, pointing eagerly. “There’s the\n",
      "White Queen running across the country! She came flying out of the wood\n",
      "over yonder—How fast those Queens _can_ run!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s some enemy after her, no doubt,” the King said, without even\n",
      "looking round. “That wood’s full of them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But aren’t you going to run and help her?” Alice asked, very much\n",
      "surprised at his taking it so quietly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No use, no use!” said the King. “She runs so fearfully quick. You\n",
      "might as well try to catch a Bandersnatch! But I’ll make a memorandum\n",
      "about her, if you like—She’s a dear good creature,” he repeated softly\n",
      "to himself, as he opened his memorandum-book. “Do you spell ‘creature’\n",
      "with a double ‘e’?”\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment the Unicorn sauntered by them, with his hands in his\n",
      "pockets. “I had the best of it this time?” he said to the King, just\n",
      "glancing at him as he passed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A little—a little,” the King replied, rather nervously. “You shouldn’t\n",
      "have run him through with your horn, you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It didn’t hurt him,” the Unicorn said carelessly, and he was going on,\n",
      "when his eye happened to fall upon Alice: he turned round rather\n",
      "instantly, and stood for some time looking at her with an air of the\n",
      "deepest disgust.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What—is—this?” he said at last.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is a child!” Haigha replied eagerly, coming in front of Alice to\n",
      "introduce her, and spreading out both his hands towards her in an\n",
      "Anglo-Saxon attitude. “We only found it to-day. It’s as large as life,\n",
      "and twice as natural!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I always thought they were fabulous monsters!” said the Unicorn. “Is\n",
      "it alive?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It can talk,” said Haigha, solemnly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Unicorn looked dreamily at Alice, and said “Talk, child.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice could not help her lips curling up into a smile as she began: “Do\n",
      "you know, I always thought Unicorns were fabulous monsters, too! I\n",
      "never saw one alive before!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, now that we _have_ seen each other,” said the Unicorn, “if\n",
      "you’ll believe in me, I’ll believe in you. Is that a bargain?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, if you like,” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come, fetch out the plum-cake, old man!” the Unicorn went on, turning\n",
      "from her to the King. “None of your brown bread for me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Certainly—certainly!” the King muttered, and beckoned to Haigha. “Open\n",
      "the bag!” he whispered. “Quick! Not that one—that’s full of hay!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Haigha took a large cake out of the bag, and gave it to Alice to hold,\n",
      "while he got out a dish and carving-knife. How they all came out of it\n",
      "Alice couldn’t guess. It was just like a conjuring-trick, she thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lion had joined them while this was going on: he looked very tired\n",
      "and sleepy, and his eyes were half shut. “What’s this!” he said,\n",
      "blinking lazily at Alice, and speaking in a deep hollow tone that\n",
      "sounded like the tolling of a great bell.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, what _is_ it, now?” the Unicorn cried eagerly. “You’ll never\n",
      "guess! _I_ couldn’t.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lion looked at Alice wearily. “Are you animal—vegetable—or\n",
      "mineral?” he said, yawning at every other word.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s a fabulous monster!” the Unicorn cried out, before Alice could\n",
      "reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then hand round the plum-cake, Monster,” the Lion said, lying down and\n",
      "putting his chin on his paws. “And sit down, both of you,” (to the King\n",
      "and the Unicorn): “fair play with the cake, you know!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The King was evidently very uncomfortable at having to sit down between\n",
      "the two great creatures; but there was no other place for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What a fight we might have for the crown, _now_!” the Unicorn said,\n",
      "looking slyly up at the crown, which the poor King was nearly shaking\n",
      "off his head, he trembled so much.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should win easy,” said the Lion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m not so sure of that,” said the Unicorn.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, I beat you all round the town, you chicken!” the Lion replied\n",
      "angrily, half getting up as he spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here the King interrupted, to prevent the quarrel going on: he was very\n",
      "nervous, and his voice quite quivered. “All round the town?” he said.\n",
      "“That’s a good long way. Did you go by the old bridge, or the\n",
      "market-place? You get the best view by the old bridge.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m sure I don’t know,” the Lion growled out as he lay down again.\n",
      "“There was too much dust to see anything. What a time the Monster is,\n",
      "cutting up that cake!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice had seated herself on the bank of a little brook, with the great\n",
      "dish on her knees, and was sawing away diligently with the knife. “It’s\n",
      "very provoking!” she said, in reply to the Lion (she was getting quite\n",
      "used to being called “the Monster”). “I’ve cut several slices already,\n",
      "but they always join on again!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You don’t know how to manage Looking-glass cakes,” the Unicorn\n",
      "remarked. “Hand it round first, and cut it afterwards.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This sounded nonsense, but Alice very obediently got up, and carried\n",
      "the dish round, and the cake divided itself into three pieces as she\n",
      "did so. “_Now_ cut it up,” said the Lion, as she returned to her place\n",
      "with the empty dish.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I say, this isn’t fair!” cried the Unicorn, as Alice sat with the\n",
      "knife in her hand, very much puzzled how to begin. “The Monster has\n",
      "given the Lion twice as much as me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She’s kept none for herself, anyhow,” said the Lion. “Do you like\n",
      "plum-cake, Monster?”\n",
      "\n",
      "But before Alice could answer him, the drums began.\n",
      "\n",
      "Where the noise came from, she couldn’t make out: the air seemed full\n",
      "of it, and it rang through and through her head till she felt quite\n",
      "deafened. She started to her feet and sprang across the little brook in\n",
      "her terror,\n",
      "\n",
      "*      *      *      *      *      *      *\n",

      "and had just time to see the Lion and the Unicorn rise to their feet,\n",
      "with angry looks at being interrupted in their feast, before she\n",
      "dropped to her knees, and put her hands over her ears, vainly trying to\n",
      "shut out the dreadful uproar.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If _that_ doesn’t ‘drum them out of town,’” she thought to herself,\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After a while the noise seemed gradually to die away, till all was dead\n",
      "silence, and Alice lifted up her head in some alarm. There was no one\n",
      "to be seen, and her first thought was that she must have been dreaming\n",
      "about the Lion and the Unicorn and those queer Anglo-Saxon Messengers.\n",
      "However, there was the great dish still lying at her feet, on which she\n",
      "had tried to cut the plum-cake, “So I wasn’t dreaming, after all,” she\n",
      "said to herself, “unless—unless we’re all part of the same dream. Only\n",
      "I do hope it’s _my_ dream, and not the Red King’s! I don’t like\n",
      "belonging to another person’s dream,” she went on in a rather\n",
      "complaining tone: “I’ve a great mind to go and wake him, and see what\n",
      "happens!”\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment her thoughts were interrupted by a loud shouting of\n",
      "“Ahoy! Ahoy! Check!” and a Knight dressed in crimson armour came\n",
      "galloping down upon her, brandishing a great club. Just as he reached\n",
      "her, the horse stopped suddenly: “You’re my prisoner!” the Knight\n",
      "cried, as he tumbled off his horse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Startled as she was, Alice was more frightened for him than for herself\n",
      "at the moment, and watched him with some anxiety as he mounted again.\n",
      "As soon as he was comfortably in the saddle, he began once more “You’re\n",
      "my—” but here another voice broke in “Ahoy! Ahoy! Check!” and Alice\n",
      "looked round in some surprise for the new enemy.\n",
      "\n",
      "This time it was a White Knight. He drew up at Alice’s side, and\n",
      "tumbled off his horse just as the Red Knight had done: then he got on\n",
      "again, and the two Knights sat and looked at each other for some time\n",
      "without speaking. Alice looked from one to the other in some\n",
      "bewilderment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She’s _my_ prisoner, you know!” the Red Knight said at last.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, but then _I_ came and rescued her!” the White Knight replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, we must fight for her, then,” said the Red Knight, as he took up\n",
      "his helmet (which hung from the saddle, and was something the shape of\n",
      "a horse’s head), and put it on.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You will observe the Rules of Battle, of course?” the White Knight\n",
      "remarked, putting on his helmet too.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I always do,” said the Red Knight, and they began banging away at each\n",
      "other with such fury that Alice got behind a tree to be out of the way\n",
      "of the blows.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wonder, now, what the Rules of Battle are,” she said to herself, as\n",
      "she watched the fight, timidly peeping out from her hiding-place: “one\n",
      "Rule seems to be, that if one Knight hits the other, he knocks him off\n",
      "his horse, and if he misses, he tumbles off himself—and another Rule\n",
      "seems to be that they hold their clubs with their arms, as if they were\n",
      "Punch and Judy—What a noise they make when they tumble! Just like a\n",
      "whole set of fire-irons falling into the fender! And how quiet the\n",
      "horses are! They let them get on and off them just as if they were\n",
      "tables!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Another Rule of Battle, that Alice had not noticed, seemed to be that\n",
      "they always fell on their heads, and the battle ended with their both\n",
      "falling off in this way, side by side: when they got up again, they\n",
      "shook hands, and then the Red Knight mounted and galloped off.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was a glorious victory, wasn’t it?” said the White Knight, as he\n",
      "came up panting.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t know,” Alice said doubtfully. “I don’t want to be anybody’s\n",
      "prisoner. I want to be a Queen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So you will, when you’ve crossed the next brook,” said the White\n",
      "Knight. “I’ll see you safe to the end of the wood—and then I must go\n",
      "back, you know. That’s the end of my move.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thank you very much,” said Alice. “May I help you off with your\n",
      "helmet?” It was evidently more than he could manage by himself;\n",
      "however, she managed to shake him out of it at last.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now one can breathe more easily,” said the Knight, putting back his\n",
      "shaggy hair with both hands, and turning his gentle face and large mild\n",
      "eyes to Alice. She thought she had never seen such a strange-looking\n",
      "soldier in all her life.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was dressed in tin armour, which seemed to fit him very badly, and\n",
      "he had a queer-shaped little deal box fastened across his shoulder,\n",
      "upside-down, and with the lid hanging open. Alice looked at it with\n",
      "great curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I see you’re admiring my little box.” the Knight said in a friendly\n",
      "tone. “It’s my own invention—to keep clothes and sandwiches in. You see\n",
      "I carry it upside-down, so that the rain can’t get in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But the things can get _out_,” Alice gently remarked. “Do you know the\n",
      "lid’s open?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I didn’t know it,” the Knight said, a shade of vexation passing over\n",
      "his face. “Then all the things must have fallen out! And the box is no\n",
      "use without them.” He unfastened it as he spoke, and was just going to\n",
      "throw it into the bushes, when a sudden thought seemed to strike him,\n",
      "and he hung it carefully on a tree. “Can you guess why I did that?” he\n",
      "said to Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice shook her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In hopes some bees may make a nest in it—then I should get the honey.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But you’ve got a bee-hive—or something like one—fastened to the\n",
      "saddle,” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, it’s a very good bee-hive,” the Knight said in a discontented\n",
      "tone, “one of the best kind. But not a single bee has come near it yet.\n",
      "And the other thing is a mouse-trap. I suppose the mice keep the bees\n",
      "out—or the bees keep the mice out, I don’t know which.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was wondering what the mouse-trap was for,” said Alice. “It isn’t\n",
      "very likely there would be any mice on the horse’s back.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not very likely, perhaps,” said the Knight: “but if they _do_ come, I\n",
      "don’t choose to have them running all about.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You see,” he went on after a pause, “it’s as well to be provided for\n",
      "_everything_. That’s the reason the horse has all those anklets round\n",
      "his feet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But what are they for?” Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“To guard against the bites of sharks,” the Knight replied. “It’s an\n",
      "invention of my own. And now help me on. I’ll go with you to the end of\n",
      "the wood—What’s the dish for?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s meant for plum-cake,” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’d better take it with us,” the Knight said. “It’ll come in handy if\n",
      "we find any plum-cake. Help me to get it into this bag.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This took a very long time to manage, though Alice held the bag open\n",
      "very carefully, because the Knight was so _very_ awkward in putting in\n",
      "the dish: the first two or three times that he tried he fell in himself\n",
      "instead. “It’s rather a tight fit, you see,” he said, as they got it in\n",
      "a last; “There are so many candlesticks in the bag.” And he hung it to\n",
      "the saddle, which was already loaded with bunches of carrots, and\n",
      "fire-irons, and many other things.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hope you’ve got your hair well fastened on?” he continued, as they\n",
      "set off.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Only in the usual way,” Alice said, smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s hardly enough,” he said, anxiously. “You see the wind is so\n",
      "_very_ strong here. It’s as strong as soup.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you invented a plan for keeping the hair from being blown off?”\n",
      "Alice enquired.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not yet,” said the Knight. “But I’ve got a plan for keeping it from\n",
      "_falling_ off.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should like to hear it, very much.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“First you take an upright stick,” said the Knight. “Then you make your\n",
      "hair creep up it, like a fruit-tree. Now the reason hair falls off is\n",
      "because it hangs _down_—things never fall _upwards_, you know. It’s a\n",
      "plan of my own invention. You may try it if you like.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It didn’t sound a comfortable plan, Alice thought, and for a few\n",
      "minutes she walked on in silence, puzzling over the idea, and every now\n",
      "and then stopping to help the poor Knight, who certainly was _not_ a\n",
      "good rider.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whenever the horse stopped (which it did very often), he fell off in\n",
      "front; and whenever it went on again (which it generally did rather\n",
      "suddenly), he fell off behind. Otherwise he kept on pretty well, except\n",
      "that he had a habit of now and then falling off sideways; and as he\n",
      "generally did this on the side on which Alice was walking, she soon\n",
      "found that it was the best plan not to walk _quite_ close to the horse.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m afraid you’ve not had much practice in riding,” she ventured to\n",
      "say, as she was helping him up from his fifth tumble.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Knight looked very much surprised, and a little offended at the\n",
      "remark. “What makes you say that?” he asked, as he scrambled back into\n",
      "the saddle, keeping hold of Alice’s hair with one hand, to save himself\n",
      "from falling over on the other side.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because people don’t fall off quite so often, when they’ve had much\n",
      "practice.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve had plenty of practice,” the Knight said very gravely: “plenty of\n",
      "practice!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice could think of nothing better to say than “Indeed?” but she said\n",
      "it as heartily as she could. They went on a little way in silence after\n",
      "this, the Knight with his eyes shut, muttering to himself, and Alice\n",
      "watching anxiously for the next tumble.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The great art of riding,” the Knight suddenly began in a loud voice,\n",
      "waving his right arm as he spoke, “is to keep—” Here the sentence ended\n",
      "as suddenly as it had begun, as the Knight fell heavily on the top of\n",
      "his head exactly in the path where Alice was walking. She was quite\n",
      "frightened this time, and said in an anxious tone, as she picked him\n",
      "up, “I hope no bones are broken?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“None to speak of,” the Knight said, as if he didn’t mind breaking two\n",
      "or three of them. “The great art of riding, as I was saying, is—to keep\n",
      "your balance properly. Like this, you know—”\n",
      "\n",
      "He let go the bridle, and stretched out both his arms to show Alice\n",
      "what he meant, and this time he fell flat on his back, right under the\n",
      "horse’s feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Plenty of practice!” he went on repeating, all the time that Alice was\n",
      "getting him on his feet again. “Plenty of practice!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s too ridiculous!” cried Alice, losing all her patience this time.\n",
      "“You ought to have a wooden horse on wheels, that you ought!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Does that kind go smoothly?” the Knight asked in a tone of great\n",
      "interest, clasping his arms round the horse’s neck as he spoke, just in\n",
      "time to save himself from tumbling off again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Much more smoothly than a live horse,” Alice said, with a little\n",
      "scream of laughter, in spite of all she could do to prevent it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll get one,” the Knight said thoughtfully to himself. “One or\n",
      "two—several.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a short silence after this, and then the Knight went on\n",
      "again. “I’m a great hand at inventing things. Now, I daresay you\n",
      "noticed, that last time you picked me up, that I was looking rather\n",
      "thoughtful?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You _were_ a little grave,” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, just then I was inventing a new way of getting over a gate—would\n",
      "you like to hear it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very much indeed,” Alice said politely.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll tell you how I came to think of it,” said the Knight. “You see, I\n",
      "said to myself, ‘The only difficulty is with the feet: the _head_ is\n",
      "high enough already.’ Now, first I put my head on the top of the\n",
      "gate—then I stand on my head—then the feet are high enough, you\n",
      "see—then I’m over, you see.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I suppose you’d be over when that was done,” Alice said\n",
      "thoughtfully: “but don’t you think it would be rather hard?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I haven’t tried it yet,” the Knight said, gravely: “so I can’t tell\n",
      "for certain—but I’m afraid it _would_ be a little hard.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked so vexed at the idea, that Alice changed the subject hastily.\n",
      "“What a curious helmet you’ve got!” she said cheerfully. “Is that your\n",
      "invention too?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Knight looked down proudly at his helmet, which hung from the\n",
      "saddle. “Yes,” he said, “but I’ve invented a better one than that—like\n",
      "a sugar loaf. When I used to wear it, if I fell off the horse, it\n",
      "always touched the ground directly. So I had a _very_ little way to\n",
      "fall, you see—But there _was_ the danger of falling _into_ it, to be\n",
      "sure. That happened to me once—and the worst of it was, before I could\n",
      "get out again, the other White Knight came and put it on. He thought it\n",
      "was his own helmet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The knight looked so solemn about it that Alice did not dare to laugh.\n",
      "“I’m afraid you must have hurt him,” she said in a trembling voice,\n",
      "“being on the top of his head.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I had to kick him, of course,” the Knight said, very seriously. “And\n",
      "then he took the helmet off again—but it took hours and hours to get me\n",
      "out. I was as fast as—as lightning, you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But that’s a different kind of fastness,” Alice objected.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Knight shook his head. “It was all kinds of fastness with me, I can\n",
      "assure you!” he said. He raised his hands in some excitement as he said\n",
      "this, and instantly rolled out of the saddle, and fell headlong into a\n",
      "deep ditch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice ran to the side of the ditch to look for him. She was rather\n",
      "startled by the fall, as for some time he had kept on very well, and\n",
      "she was afraid that he really _was_ hurt this time. However, though she\n",
      "could see nothing but the soles of his feet, she was much relieved to\n",
      "hear that he was talking on in his usual tone. “All kinds of fastness,”\n",
      "he repeated: “but it was careless of him to put another man’s helmet\n",
      "on—with the man in it, too.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How _can_ you go on talking so quietly, head downwards?” Alice asked,\n",
      "as she dragged him out by the feet, and laid him in a heap on the bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Knight looked surprised at the question. “What does it matter where\n",
      "my body happens to be?” he said. “My mind goes on working all the same.\n",
      "In fact, the more head downwards I am, the more I keep inventing new\n",
      "things.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now the cleverest thing of the sort that I ever did,” he went on after\n",
      "a pause, “was inventing a new pudding during the meat-course.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In time to have it cooked for the next course?” said Alice. “Well, not\n",
      "the _next_ course,” the Knight said in a slow thoughtful tone: “no,\n",
      "certainly not the next _course_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then it would have to be the next day. I suppose you wouldn’t have two\n",
      "pudding-courses in one dinner?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, not the _next_ day,” the Knight repeated as before: “not the\n",
      "next _day_. In fact,” he went on, holding his head down, and his voice\n",
      "getting lower and lower, “I don’t believe that pudding ever _was_\n",
      "cooked! In fact, I don’t believe that pudding ever _will_ be cooked!\n",
      "And yet it was a very clever pudding to invent.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What did you mean it to be made of?” Alice asked, hoping to cheer him\n",
      "up, for the poor Knight seemed quite low-spirited about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It began with blotting paper,” the Knight answered with a groan.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That wouldn’t be very nice, I’m afraid—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not very nice _alone_,” he interrupted, quite eagerly: “but you’ve no\n",
      "idea what a difference it makes mixing it with other things—such as\n",
      "gunpowder and sealing-wax. And here I must leave you.” They had just\n",
      "come to the end of the wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice could only look puzzled: she was thinking of the pudding.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are sad,” the Knight said in an anxious tone: “let me sing you a\n",
      "song to comfort you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is it very long?” Alice asked, for she had heard a good deal of poetry\n",
      "that day.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s long,” said the Knight, “but very, _very_ beautiful. Everybody\n",
      "that hears me sing it—either it brings the _tears_ into their eyes, or\n",
      "else—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Or else what?” said Alice, for the Knight had made a sudden pause.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Or else it doesn’t, you know. The name of the song is called\n",
      "‘_Haddocks’ Eyes_.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, that’s the name of the song, is it?” Alice said, trying to feel\n",
      "interested.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, you don’t understand,” the Knight said, looking a little vexed.\n",
      "“That’s what the name is _called_. The name really _is_ ‘_The Aged Aged\n",
      "Man_.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then I ought to have said ‘That’s what the _song_ is called’?” Alice\n",
      "corrected herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, you oughtn’t: that’s quite another thing! The _song_ is called\n",
      "‘_Ways and Means_’: but that’s only what it’s _called_, you know!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, what _is_ the song, then?” said Alice, who was by this time\n",
      "completely bewildered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was coming to that,” the Knight said. “The song really _is_\n",
      "‘_A-sitting On A Gate_’: and the tune’s my own invention.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So saying, he stopped his horse and let the reins fall on its neck:\n",
      "then, slowly beating time with one hand, and with a faint smile\n",
      "lighting up his gentle foolish face, as if he enjoyed the music of his\n",
      "song, he began.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of all the strange things that Alice saw in her journey Through The\n",
      "Looking-Glass, this was the one that she always remembered most\n",
      "clearly. Years afterwards she could bring the whole scene back again,\n",
      "as if it had been only yesterday—the mild blue eyes and kindly smile of\n",
      "the Knight—the setting sun gleaming through his hair, and shining on\n",
      "his armour in a blaze of light that quite dazzled her—the horse quietly\n",
      "moving about, with the reins hanging loose on his neck, cropping the\n",
      "grass at her feet—and the black shadows of the forest behind—all this\n",
      "she took in like a picture, as, with one hand shading her eyes, she\n",
      "leant against a tree, watching the strange pair, and listening, in a\n",
      "half dream, to the melancholy music of the song.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But the tune _isn’t_ his own invention,” she said to herself: “it’s\n",
      "‘_I give thee all, I can no more_.’” She stood and listened very\n",
      "attentively, but no tears came into her eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll tell thee everything I can;\n",
      "    There’s little to relate.\n",
      "I saw an aged aged man,\n",
      "    A-sitting on a gate.\n",
      "‘Who are you, aged man?’ I said,\n",
      "    ‘and how is it you live?’\n",
      "And his answer trickled through my head\n",
      "    Like water through a sieve.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said ‘I look for butterflies\n",
      "    That sleep among the wheat:\n",
      "I make them into mutton-pies,\n",
      "    And sell them in the street.\n",

      "And that’s the way I get my bread—\n",
      "    A trifle, if you please.’\n",

      "So, having no reply to give\n",
      "    To what the old man said,\n",
      "I cried, ‘Come, tell me how you live!’\n",

      "    In the silent night.\n",

      "herself, as she stood watching him. “There he goes! Right on his head\n",
      "as usual! However, he gets on again pretty easily—that comes of having\n",
      "so many things hung round the horse—” So she went on talking to\n",
      "herself, as she watched the horse walking leisurely along the road, and\n",
      "the Knight tumbling off, first on one side and then on the other. After\n",
      "the fourth or fifth tumble he reached the turn, and then she waved her\n",

      "here! And what _is_ this on my head?” she exclaimed in a tone of\n",
      "dismay, as she put her hands up to something very heavy, and fitted\n",
      "tight all round her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But how _can_ it have got there without my knowing it?” she said to\n",

      "\n",
      "“Well, this _is_ grand!” said Alice. “I never expected I should be a\n",
      "Queen so soon—and I’ll tell you what it is, your majesty,” she went on\n",
      "in a severe tone (she was always rather fond of scolding herself),\n",
      "“it’ll never do for you to be lolling about on the grass like that!\n",
      "Queens have to be dignified, you know!”\n",
      "\n",
      "So she got up and walked about—rather stiffly just at first, as she was\n",
      "afraid that the crown might come off: but she comforted herself with\n",
      "the thought that there was nobody to see her, “and if I really am a\n",
      "Queen,” she said as she sat down again, “I shall be able to manage it\n",
      "quite well in time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything was happening so oddly that she didn’t feel a bit surprised\n",
      "at finding the Red Queen and the White Queen sitting close to her, one\n",
      "on each side: she would have liked very much to ask them how they came\n",
      "there, but she feared it would not be quite civil. However, there would\n",
      "be no harm, she thought, in asking if the game was over. “Please, would\n",
      "you tell me—” she began, looking timidly at the Red Queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Speak when you’re spoken to!” The Queen sharply interrupted her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But if everybody obeyed that rule,” said Alice, who was always ready\n",
      "for a little argument, “and if you only spoke when you were spoken to,\n",
      "and the other person always waited for _you_ to begin, you see nobody\n",
      "would ever say anything, so that—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ridiculous!” cried the Queen. “Why, don’t you see, child—” here she\n",
      "broke off with a frown, and, after thinking for a minute, suddenly\n",
      "changed the subject of the conversation. “What do you mean by ‘If you\n",
      "really are a Queen’? What right have you to call yourself so? You can’t\n",
      "be a Queen, you know, till you’ve passed the proper examination. And\n",
      "the sooner we begin it, the better.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I only said ‘if’!” poor Alice pleaded in a piteous tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two Queens looked at each other, and the Red Queen remarked, with a\n",
      "little shudder, “She _says_ she only said ‘if’—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But she said a great deal more than that!” the White Queen moaned,\n",
      "wringing her hands. “Oh, ever so much more than that!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So you did, you know,” the Red Queen said to Alice. “Always speak the\n",
      "truth—think before you speak—and write it down afterwards.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m sure I didn’t mean—” Alice was beginning, but the Red Queen\n",
      "interrupted her impatiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s just what I complain of! You _should_ have meant! What do you\n",
      "suppose is the use of child without any meaning? Even a joke should\n",
      "have some meaning—and a child’s more important than a joke, I hope. You\n",
      "couldn’t deny that, even if you tried with both hands.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t deny things with my _hands_,” Alice objected.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nobody said you did,” said the Red Queen. “I said you couldn’t if you\n",
      "tried.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She’s in that state of mind,” said the White Queen, “that she wants to\n",
      "deny _something_—only she doesn’t know what to deny!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A nasty, vicious temper,” the Red Queen remarked; and then there was\n",
      "an uncomfortable silence for a minute or two.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Red Queen broke the silence by saying to the White Queen, “I invite\n",
      "you to Alice’s dinner-party this afternoon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The White Queen smiled feebly, and said “And I invite _you_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I didn’t know I was to have a party at all,” said Alice; “but if there\n",
      "is to be one, I think _I_ ought to invite the guests.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We gave you the opportunity of doing it,” the Red Queen remarked: “but\n",
      "I daresay you’ve not had many lessons in manners yet?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Manners are not taught in lessons,” said Alice. “Lessons teach you to\n",
      "do sums, and things of that sort.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And you do Addition?” the White Queen asked. “What’s one and one and\n",
      "one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t know,” said Alice. “I lost count.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She can’t do Addition,” the Red Queen interrupted. “Can you do\n",
      "Subtraction? Take nine from eight.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nine from eight I can’t, you know,” Alice replied very readily: “but—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She can’t do Subtraction,” said the White Queen. “Can you do Division?\n",
      "Divide a loaf by a knife—what’s the answer to that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I suppose—” Alice was beginning, but the Red Queen answered for her.\n",
      "“Bread-and-butter, of course. Try another Subtraction sum. Take a bone\n",
      "from a dog: what remains?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice considered. “The bone wouldn’t remain, of course, if I took\n",
      "it—and the dog wouldn’t remain; it would come to bite me—and I’m sure\n",
      "_I_ shouldn’t remain!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then you think nothing would remain?” said the Red Queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think that’s the answer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wrong, as usual,” said the Red Queen: “the dog’s temper would remain.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I don’t see how—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, look here!” the Red Queen cried. “The dog would lose its temper,\n",
      "wouldn’t it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perhaps it would,” Alice replied cautiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then if the dog went away, its temper would remain!” the Queen\n",
      "exclaimed triumphantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice said, as gravely as she could, “They might go different ways.”\n",
      "But she couldn’t help thinking to herself, “What dreadful nonsense we\n",
      "_are_ talking!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She can’t do sums a _bit_!” the Queens said together, with great\n",
      "emphasis.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Can _you_ do sums?” Alice said, turning suddenly on the White Queen,\n",
      "for she didn’t like being found fault with so much.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Queen gasped and shut her eyes. “I can do Addition, if you give me\n",
      "time—but I can’t do Subtraction, under _any_ circumstances!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course you know your A B C?” said the Red Queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“To be sure I do.” said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So do I,” the White Queen whispered: “we’ll often say it over\n",
      "together, dear. And I’ll tell you a secret—I can read words of one\n",
      "letter! Isn’t _that_ grand! However, don’t be discouraged. You’ll come\n",
      "to it in time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Here the Red Queen began again. “Can you answer useful questions?” she\n",
      "said. “How is bread made?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know _that_!” Alice cried eagerly. “You take some flour—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where do you pick the flower?” the White Queen asked. “In a garden, or\n",
      "in the hedges?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, it isn’t _picked_ at all,” Alice explained: “it’s _ground_—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How many acres of ground?” said the White Queen. “You mustn’t leave\n",
      "out so many things.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fan her head!” the Red Queen anxiously interrupted. “She’ll be\n",
      "feverish after so much thinking.” So they set to work and fanned her\n",
      "with bunches of leaves, till she had to beg them to leave off, it blew\n",
      "her hair about so.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She’s all right again now,” said the Red Queen. “Do you know\n",
      "Languages? What’s the French for fiddle-de-dee?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fiddle-de-dee’s not English,” Alice replied gravely.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who ever said it was?” said the Red Queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice thought she saw a way out of the difficulty this time. “If you’ll\n",
      "tell me what language ‘fiddle-de-dee’ is, I’ll tell you the French for\n",
      "it!” she exclaimed triumphantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Red Queen drew herself up rather stiffly, and said “Queens\n",
      "never make bargains.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wish Queens never asked questions,” Alice thought to herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t let us quarrel,” the White Queen said in an anxious tone. “What\n",
      "is the cause of lightning?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The cause of lightning,” Alice said very decidedly, for she felt quite\n",
      "certain about this, “is the thunder—no, no!” she hastily corrected\n",
      "herself. “I meant the other way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s too late to correct it,” said the Red Queen: “when you’ve once\n",
      "said a thing, that fixes it, and you must take the consequences.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Which reminds me—” the White Queen said, looking down and nervously\n",
      "clasping and unclasping her hands, “we had _such_ a thunderstorm last\n",
      "Tuesday—I mean one of the last set of Tuesdays, you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was puzzled. “In _our_ country,” she remarked, “there’s only one\n",
      "day at a time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Red Queen said, “That’s a poor thin way of doing things. Now\n",
      "_here_, we mostly have days and nights two or three at a time, and\n",
      "sometimes in the winter we take as many as five nights together—for\n",
      "warmth, you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are five nights warmer than one night, then?” Alice ventured to ask.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Five times as warm, of course.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But they should be five times as _cold_, by the same rule—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Just so!” cried the Red Queen. “Five times as warm, _and_ five times\n",
      "as cold—just as I’m five times as rich as you are, _and_ five times as\n",
      "clever!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice sighed and gave it up. “It’s exactly like a riddle with no\n",
      "answer!” she thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Humpty Dumpty saw it too,” the White Queen went on in a low voice,\n",
      "more as if she were talking to herself. “He came to the door with a\n",
      "corkscrew in his hand—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What did he want?” said the Red Queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He said he _would_ come in,” the White Queen went on, “because he was\n",
      "looking for a hippopotamus. Now, as it happened, there wasn’t such a\n",
      "thing in the house, that morning.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is there generally?” Alice asked in an astonished tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, only on Thursdays,” said the Queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know what he came for,” said Alice: “he wanted to punish the fish,\n",
      "because—”\n",
      "\n",
      "Here the White Queen began again. “It was _such_ a thunderstorm, you\n",
      "can’t think!” (“She _never_ could, you know,” said the Red Queen.) “And\n",
      "part of the roof came off, and ever so much thunder got in—and it went\n",
      "rolling round the room in great lumps—and knocking over the tables and\n",
      "things—till I was so frightened, I couldn’t remember my own name!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice thought to herself, “I never should _try_ to remember my name in\n",
      "the middle of an accident! Where would be the use of it?” but she did\n",
      "not say this aloud, for fear of hurting the poor Queen’s feeling.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your Majesty must excuse her,” the Red Queen said to Alice, taking one\n",
      "of the White Queen’s hands in her own, and gently stroking it: “she\n",
      "means well, but she can’t help saying foolish things, as a general\n",
      "rule.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The White Queen looked timidly at Alice, who felt she _ought_ to say\n",
      "something kind, but really couldn’t think of anything at the moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She never was really well brought up,” the Red Queen went on: “but\n",
      "it’s amazing how good-tempered she is! Pat her on the head, and see how\n",
      "pleased she’ll be!” But this was more than Alice had courage to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A little kindness—and putting her hair in papers—would do wonders with\n",
      "her—”\n",
      "\n",
      "The White Queen gave a deep sigh, and laid her head on Alice’s\n",
      "shoulder. “I _am_ so sleepy?” she moaned.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She’s tired, poor thing!” said the Red Queen. “Smooth her hair—lend\n",
      "her your nightcap—and sing her a soothing lullaby.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I haven’t got a nightcap with me,” said Alice, as she tried to obey\n",
      "the first direction: “and I don’t know any soothing lullabies.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I must do it myself, then,” said the Red Queen, and she began:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hush-a-by lady, in Alice’s lap!\n",
      "Till the feast’s ready, we’ve time for a nap:\n",
      "When the feast’s over, we’ll go to the ball—\n",
      "Red Queen, and White Queen, and Alice, and all!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“And now you know the words,” she added, as she put her head down on\n",
      "Alice’s other shoulder, “just sing it through to _me_. I’m getting\n",
      "sleepy, too.” In another moment both Queens were fast asleep, and\n",
      "snoring loud.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What _am_ I to do?” exclaimed Alice, looking about in great\n",
      "perplexity, as first one round head, and then the other, rolled down\n",
      "from her shoulder, and lay like a heavy lump in her lap. “I don’t think\n",
      "it _ever_ happened before, that any one had to take care of two Queens\n",
      "asleep at once! No, not in all the History of England—it couldn’t, you\n",
      "know, because there never was more than one Queen at a time. Do wake\n",
      "up, you heavy things!” she went on in an impatient tone; but there was\n",
      "no answer but a gentle snoring.\n",
      "\n",
      "The snoring got more distinct every minute, and sounded more like a\n",
      "tune: at last she could even make out the words, and she listened so\n",
      "eagerly that, when the two great heads vanished from her lap, she\n",
      "hardly missed them.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was standing before an arched doorway over which were the words\n",
      "QUEEN ALICE in large letters, and on each side of the arch there was a\n",
      "bell-handle; one was marked “Visitors’ Bell,” and the other “Servants’\n",
      "Bell.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll wait till the song’s over,” thought Alice, “and then I’ll\n",
      "ring—the—_which_ bell must I ring?” she went on, very much puzzled by\n",
      "the names. “I’m not a visitor, and I’m not a servant. There _ought_ to\n",
      "be one marked ‘Queen,’ you know—”\n",
      "\n",
      "Just then the door opened a little way, and a creature with a long beak\n",
      "put its head out for a moment and said “No admittance till the week\n",
      "after next!” and shut the door again with a bang.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice knocked and rang in vain for a long time, but at last, a very old\n",
      "Frog, who was sitting under a tree, got up and hobbled slowly towards\n",
      "her: he was dressed in bright yellow, and had enormous boots on.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is it, now?” the Frog said in a deep hoarse whisper.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice turned round, ready to find fault with anybody. “Where’s the\n",
      "servant whose business it is to answer the door?” she began angrily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Which door?” said the Frog.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice almost stamped with irritation at the slow drawl in which he\n",
      "spoke. “_This_ door, of course!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Frog looked at the door with his large dull eyes for a minute: then\n",
      "he went nearer and rubbed it with his thumb, as if he were trying\n",
      "whether the paint would come off; then he looked at Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“To answer the door?” he said. “What’s it been asking of?” He was so\n",
      "hoarse that Alice could scarcely hear him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t know what you mean,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I talks English, doesn’t I?” the Frog went on. “Or are you deaf? What\n",
      "did it ask you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing!” Alice said impatiently. “I’ve been knocking at it!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shouldn’t do that—shouldn’t do that—” the Frog muttered. “Vexes it,\n",
      "you know.” Then he went up and gave the door a kick with one of his\n",
      "great feet. “You let _it_ alone,” he panted out, as he hobbled back to\n",
      "his tree, “and it’ll let _you_ alone, you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment the door was flung open, and a shrill voice was heard\n",
      "singing:\n",
      "\n",
      "“To the Looking-Glass world it was Alice that said,\n",
      "‘I’ve a sceptre in hand, I’ve a crown on my head;\n",
      "Let the Looking-Glass creatures, whatever they be,\n",
      "Come and dine with the Red Queen, the White Queen, and me.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And hundreds of voices joined in the chorus:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then fill up the glasses as quick as you can,\n",
      "And sprinkle the table with buttons and bran:\n",
      "Put cats in the coffee, and mice in the tea—\n",
      "And welcome Queen Alice with thirty-times-three!”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then followed a confused noise of cheering, and Alice thought to\n",
      "herself, “Thirty times three makes ninety. I wonder if any one’s\n",
      "counting?” In a minute there was silence again, and the same shrill\n",
      "voice sang another verse;\n",
      "\n",

      "Along with the Red Queen, the White Queen, and me!’”\n",

      "\n",
      "“Then fill up the glasses with treacle and ink,\n",
      "Or anything else that is pleasant to drink:\n",
      "Mix sand with the cider, and wool with the wine—\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ninety times nine!” Alice repeated in despair, “Oh, that’ll never be\n",
      "done! I’d better go in at once—” and there was a dead silence the\n",
      "moment she appeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice glanced nervously along the table, as she walked up the large\n",
      "hall, and noticed that there were about fifty guests, of all kinds:\n",
      "some were animals, some birds, and there were even a few flowers among\n",
      "them. “I’m glad they’ve come without waiting to be asked,” she thought:\n",
      "“I should never have known who were the right people to invite!”\n",
      "\n",
      "There were three chairs at the head of the table; the Red and White\n",
      "Queens had already taken two of them, but the middle one was empty.\n",
      "Alice sat down in it, rather uncomfortable in the silence, and longing\n",
      "for some one to speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last the Red Queen began. “You’ve missed the soup and fish,” she\n",
      "said. “Put on the joint!” And the waiters set a leg of mutton before\n",
      "Alice, who looked at it rather anxiously, as she had never had to carve\n",
      "a joint before.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You look a little shy; let me introduce you to that leg of mutton,”\n",
      "said the Red Queen. “Alice—Mutton; Mutton—Alice.” The leg of mutton got\n",
      "up in the dish and made a little bow to Alice; and Alice returned the\n",
      "bow, not knowing whether to be frightened or amused.\n",
      "\n",
      "“May I give you a slice?” she said, taking up the knife and fork, and\n",
      "looking from one Queen to the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Certainly not,” the Red Queen said, very decidedly: “it isn’t\n",
      "etiquette to cut any one you’ve been introduced to. Remove the joint!”\n",
      "And the waiters carried it off, and brought a large plum-pudding in its\n",
      "place.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I won’t be introduced to the pudding, please,” Alice said rather\n",
      "hastily, “or we shall get no dinner at all. May I give you some?”\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Red Queen looked sulky, and growled “Pudding—Alice;\n",
      "Alice—Pudding. Remove the pudding!” and the waiters took it away so\n",
      "quickly that Alice couldn’t return its bow.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, she didn’t see why the Red Queen should be the only one to\n",
      "give orders, so, as an experiment, she called out “Waiter! Bring back\n",
      "the pudding!” and there it was again in a moment like a\n",
      "conjuring-trick. It was so large that she couldn’t help feeling a\n",
      "_little_ shy with it, as she had been with the mutton; however, she\n",
      "conquered her shyness by a great effort and cut a slice and handed it\n",
      "to the Red Queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What impertinence!” said the Pudding. “I wonder how you’d like it, if\n",
      "I were to cut a slice out of _you_, you creature!”\n",
      "\n",
      "It spoke in a thick, suety sort of voice, and Alice hadn’t a word to\n",
      "say in reply: she could only sit and look at it and gasp.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Make a remark,” said the Red Queen: “it’s ridiculous to leave all the\n",
      "conversation to the pudding!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you know, I’ve had such a quantity of poetry repeated to me\n",
      "to-day,” Alice began, a little frightened at finding that, the moment\n",
      "she opened her lips, there was dead silence, and all eyes were fixed\n",
      "upon her; “and it’s a very curious thing, I think—every poem was about\n",
      "fishes in some way. Do you know why they’re so fond of fishes, all\n",
      "about here?”\n",
      "\n",
      "She spoke to the Red Queen, whose answer was a little wide of the mark.\n",
      "“As to fishes,” she said, very slowly and solemnly, putting her mouth\n",
      "close to Alice’s ear, “her White Majesty knows a lovely riddle—all in\n",
      "poetry—all about fishes. Shall she repeat it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Her Red Majesty’s very kind to mention it,” the White Queen murmured\n",
      "into Alice’s other ear, in a voice like the cooing of a pigeon. “It\n",
      "would be _such_ a treat! May I?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Please do,” Alice said very politely.\n",
      "\n",
      "The White Queen laughed with delight, and stroked Alice’s cheek. Then\n",
      "she began:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “‘First, the fish must be caught.’\n",
      "That is easy: a baby, I think, could have caught it.\n",
      "    ‘Next, the fish must be bought.’\n",
      "That is easy: a penny, I think, would have bought it.\n",
      "\n",
      "    ‘Now cook me the fish!’\n",
      "That is easy, and will not take more than a minute.\n",
      "    ‘Let it lie in a dish!’\n",
      "That is easy, because it already is in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "    ‘Bring it here! Let me sup!’\n",
      "It is easy to set such a dish on the table.\n",
      "    ‘Take the dish-cover up!’\n",
      "Ah, that is so hard that I fear I’m unable!\n",
      "\n",
      "    For it holds it like glue—\n",
      "Holds the lid to the dish, while it lies in the middle:\n",
      "    Which is easiest to do,\n",
      "Un-dish-cover the fish, or dishcover the riddle?”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Take a minute to think about it, and then guess,” said the Red Queen.\n",
      "“Meanwhile, we’ll drink your health—Queen Alice’s health!” she screamed\n",
      "at the top of her voice, and all the guests began drinking it directly,\n",
      "and very queerly they managed it: some of them put their glasses upon\n",
      "their heads like extinguishers, and drank all that trickled down their\n",
      "faces—others upset the decanters, and drank the wine as it ran off the\n",
      "edges of the table—and three of them (who looked like kangaroos)\n",
      "scrambled into the dish of roast mutton, and began eagerly lapping up\n",
      "the gravy, “just like pigs in a trough!” thought Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You ought to return thanks in a neat speech,” the Red Queen said,\n",
      "frowning at Alice as she spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We must support you, you know,” the White Queen whispered, as Alice\n",
      "got up to do it, very obediently, but a little frightened.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thank you very much,” she whispered in reply, “but I can do quite well\n",
      "without.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That wouldn’t be at all the thing,” the Red Queen said very decidedly:\n",
      "so Alice tried to submit to it with a good grace.\n",
      "\n",
      "(“And they _did_ push so!” she said afterwards, when she was telling\n",
      "her sister the history of the feast. “You would have thought they\n",
      "wanted to squeeze me flat!”)\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact it was rather difficult for her to keep in her place while she\n",
      "made her speech: the two Queens pushed her so, one on each side, that\n",
      "they nearly lifted her up into the air: “I rise to return thanks—”\n",
      "Alice began: and she really _did_ rise as she spoke, several inches;\n",
      "but she got hold of the edge of the table, and managed to pull herself\n",
      "down again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Take care of yourself!” screamed the White Queen, seizing Alice’s hair\n",
      "with both her hands. “Something’s going to happen!”\n",
      "\n",
      "And then (as Alice afterwards described it) all sorts of things\n",
      "happened in a moment. The candles all grew up to the ceiling, looking\n",
      "something like a bed of rushes with fireworks at the top. As to the\n",
      "bottles, they each took a pair of plates, which they hastily fitted on\n",
      "as wings, and so, with forks for legs, went fluttering about in all\n",
      "directions: “and very like birds they look,” Alice thought to herself,\n",
      "as well as she could in the dreadful confusion that was beginning.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment she heard a hoarse laugh at her side, and turned to see\n",
      "what was the matter with the White Queen; but, instead of the Queen,\n",
      "there was the leg of mutton sitting in the chair. “Here I am!” cried a\n",
      "voice from the soup tureen, and Alice turned again, just in time to see\n",
      "the Queen’s broad good-natured face grinning at her for a moment over\n",
      "the edge of the tureen, before she disappeared into the soup.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was not a moment to be lost. Already several of the guests were\n",
      "lying down in the dishes, and the soup ladle was walking up the table\n",
      "towards Alice’s chair, and beckoning to her impatiently to get out of\n",
      "its way.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can’t stand this any longer!” she cried as she jumped up and seized\n",
      "the table-cloth with both hands: one good pull, and plates, dishes,\n",
      "guests, and candles came crashing down together in a heap on the floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And as for _you_,” she went on, turning fiercely upon the Red Queen,\n",
      "whom she considered as the cause of all the mischief—but the Queen was\n",
      "no longer at her side—she had suddenly dwindled down to the size of a\n",
      "little doll, and was now on the table, merrily running round and round\n",
      "after her own shawl, which was trailing behind her.\n",
      "\n",
      "At any other time, Alice would have felt surprised at this, but she was\n",
      "far too much excited to be surprised at anything _now_. “As for _you_,”\n",
      "she repeated, catching hold of the little creature in the very act of\n",
      "jumping over a bottle which had just lighted upon the table, “I’ll\n",
      "shake you into a kitten, that I will!”\n",

      "forwards with all her might.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Red Queen made no resistance whatever; only her face grew very\n",
      "small, and her eyes got large and green: and still, as Alice went on\n",

      "woke me out of oh! such a nice dream! And you’ve been along with me,\n",
      "Kitty—all through the Looking-Glass world. Did you know it, dear?”\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a very inconvenient habit of kittens (Alice had once made the\n",
      "remark) that, whatever you say to them, they _always_ purr. “If they\n",
      "would only purr for ‘yes’ and mew for ‘no,’ or any rule of that sort,”\n",
      "she had said, “so that one could keep up a conversation! But how _can_\n",
      "you talk with a person if they always say the same thing?”\n",
      "\n",
      "On this occasion the kitten only purred: and it was impossible to guess\n",
      "whether it meant “yes” or “no.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So Alice hunted among the chessmen on the table till she had found the\n",
      "Red Queen: then she went down on her knees on the hearth-rug, and put\n",
      "the kitten and the Queen to look at each other. “Now, Kitty!” she\n",
      "cried, clapping her hands triumphantly. “Confess that was what you\n",
      "turned into!”\n",
      "\n",
      "(“But it wouldn’t look at it,” she said, when she was explaining the\n",
      "thing afterwards to her sister: “it turned away its head, and pretended\n",
      "not to see it: but it looked a _little_ ashamed of itself, so I think\n",
      "it _must_ have been the Red Queen.”)\n",
      "\n",

      "“And curtsey while you’re thinking what to—what to purr. It saves time,\n",
      "remember!” And she caught it up and gave it one little kiss, “just in\n",
      "honour of having been a Red Queen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Snowdrop, my pet!” she went on, looking over her shoulder at the White\n",

      "      sensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his\n",
      "      attachment to her must be imaginary. But still he would be her\n",
      "      husband. Without thinking highly either of men or matrimony,\n",
      "      marriage had always been her object; it was the only provision\n",

      "      from her aunt that Pemberley was situated. It was not in their\n",

      "      over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed an\n",
      "      inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his\n",

      "\n",
      "      “My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have\n",

      "      there, you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "      Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at\n",
      "      Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing\n",
      "      it. She must own that she was tired of seeing great houses; after\n",
      "      going over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or\n",
      "      satin curtains.\n",
      "\n",
      "      Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. “If it were merely a fine\n",

      "      possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place,\n",
      "      instantly occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very\n",
      "      idea, and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt\n",
      "      than to run such a risk. But against this there were objections;\n",
      "      and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource, if\n",
      "      her private enquiries to the absence of the family were\n",
      "      unfavourably answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "      Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid\n",

      "      of its proprietor? and, with no little alarm, whether the family\n",

      "      herself; and when the subject was revived the next morning, and\n",
      "      she was again applied to, could readily answer, and with a proper\n",

      "      they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.\n",
      "\n",
      "      The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground.\n",

      "\n",
      "      Elizabeth’s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and\n",
      "      admired every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually\n",
      "      ascended for half-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of\n",
      "      a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was\n",
      "      instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite\n",
      "      side of a valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound.\n",
      "      It was a large, handsome stone building, standing well on rising\n",
      "      ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills; and in front,\n",
      "      a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but\n",
      "      without any artificial appearance. Its banks were neither formal\n",
      "      nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She had never seen\n",
      "      a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty\n",
      "      had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were\n",
      "      all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt\n",
      "      that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!\n",
      "\n",
      "      They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the\n",

      "      her apprehension of meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest\n",
      "      the chambermaid had been mistaken. On applying to see the place,\n",
      "      they were admitted into the hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited\n",
      "      for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her being where she\n",
      "      was.\n",
      "\n",
      "      The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman, much\n",
      "      less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding\n",
      "      her. They followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large,\n",
      "      well proportioned room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after\n",
      "      slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect.\n",
      "      The hill, crowned with wood, which they had descended, receiving\n",
      "      increased abruptness from the distance, was a beautiful object.\n",
      "      Every disposition of the ground was good; and she looked on the\n",
      "      whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its banks and the\n",
      "      winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it, with\n",
      "      delight. As they passed into other rooms these objects were\n",
      "      taking different positions; but from every window there were\n",
      "      beauties to be seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their\n",
      "      furniture suitable to the fortune of its proprietor; but\n",
      "      Elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither\n",
      "      gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of splendour, and more real\n",
      "      elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.\n",

      "      him by Mrs. Reynolds was of no trifling nature. What praise is\n",
      "      more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant? As a\n",
      "      brother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many people’s\n",

      "      before the canvas on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes\n",
      "      upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment\n",

      "      the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They\n",
      "      crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air\n",
      "      of the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet\n",

      "      room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough\n",

      "      windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived\n",
      "      their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner, who was not a great\n",
      "      walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the\n",
      "      carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was, therefore,\n",
      "      obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on\n",
      "      the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but\n",
      "      their progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to\n",

      "      engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in\n",
      "      the water, and talking to the man about them, that he advanced\n",
      "      but little. Whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were\n",
      "      again surprised, and Elizabeth’s astonishment was quite equal to\n",
      "      what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy approaching\n",

      "      sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before\n",
      "      they met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more\n",
      "      prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and\n",
      "      to speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a\n",
      "      few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into\n",
      "      some other path. The idea lasted while a turning in the walk\n",
      "      concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was\n",
      "      immediately before them. With a glance, she saw that he had lost\n",

      "      began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place; but she\n",
      "      had not got beyond the words “delightful,” and “charming,” when\n",
      "      some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise\n",

      "      decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions.\n",
      "      That he was _surprised_ by the connection was evident; he\n",
      "      sustained it, however, with fortitude, and so far from going\n",
      "      away, turned back with them, and entered into conversation with\n",

      "      triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had some\n",
      "      relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most\n",
      "      attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every\n",

      "      intelligence, his taste, or his good manners.\n",
      "\n",

      "      offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle, and\n",
      "      pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually\n",
      "      most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was walking arm-in-arm with\n",
      "      Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder. Elizabeth said\n",
      "      nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be\n",
      "      all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was extreme, and\n",
      "      continually was she repeating, “Why is he so altered? From what\n",
      "      can it proceed? It cannot be for _me_—it cannot be for _my_ sake\n",
      "      that his manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could\n",

      "      to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some\n",
      "      curious water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It\n",
      "      originated in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the\n",
      "      morning, found Elizabeth’s arm inadequate to her support, and\n",
      "      consequently preferred her husband’s. Mr. Darcy took her place by\n",
      "      her niece, and they walked on together. After a short silence,\n",
      "      the lady first spoke. She wished him to know that she had been\n",
      "      assured of his absence before she came to the place, and\n",
      "      accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been very\n",
      "      unexpected—“for your housekeeper,” she added, “informed us that\n",
      "      you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed,\n",
      "      before we left Bakewell, we understood that you were not\n",
      "      immediately expected in the country.” He acknowledged the truth\n",
      "      of it all, and said that business with his steward had occasioned\n",
      "      his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with\n",
      "      whom he had been travelling. “They will join me early to-morrow,”\n",
      "      he continued, “and among them are some who will claim an\n",
      "      acquaintance with you—Mr. Bingley and his sisters.”\n",
      "\n",
      "      Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were\n",
      "      instantly driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley’s name had\n",
      "      been the last mentioned between them; and, if she might judge by\n",
      "      his complexion, _his_ mind was not very differently engaged.\n",
      "\n",
      "      “There is also one other person in the party,” he continued after\n",
      "      a pause, “who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will\n",
      "      you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to\n",
      "      your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?”\n",
      "\n",
      "      The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too\n",
      "      great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She\n",
      "      immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of\n",
      "      being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother, and,\n",
      "      without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying\n",
      "      to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of\n",
      "      her.\n",
      "\n",
      "      They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought.\n",

      "      flattered and pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her\n",
      "      was a compliment of the highest kind. They soon outstripped the\n",
      "      others, and when they had reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs.\n",
      "      Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "      He then asked her to walk into the house—but she declared herself\n",
      "      not tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time\n",
      "      much might have been said, and silence was very awkward. She\n",
      "      wanted to talk, but there seemed to be an embargo on every\n",
      "      subject. At last she recollected that she had been travelling,\n",
      "      and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance.\n",
      "      Yet time and her aunt moved slowly—and her patience and her ideas\n",

      "\n",
      "      On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s coming up they were all pressed to go\n",
      "      into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined,\n",
      "      and they parted on each side with utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy\n",
      "      handed the ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off,\n",
      "      Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "      The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of\n",
      "      them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they\n",
      "      had expected. “He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and\n",
      "      unassuming,” said her uncle.\n",
      "\n",
      "      “There _is_ something a little stately in him, to be sure,”\n",
      "      replied her aunt, “but it is confined to his air, and is not\n",
      "      unbecoming. I can now say with the housekeeper, that though some\n",
      "      people may call him proud, _I_ have seen nothing of it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "      “I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was\n",
      "      more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no\n",
      "      necessity for such attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was\n",
      "      very trifling.”\n",
      "\n",
      "      “To be sure, Lizzy,” said her aunt, “he is not so handsome as\n",
      "      Wickham; or, rather, he has not Wickham’s countenance, for his\n",
      "      features are perfectly good. But how came you to tell me that he\n",
      "      was so disagreeable?”\n",
      "\n",
      "      Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had\n",
      "      liked him better when they had met in Kent than before, and that\n",
      "      she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "      “But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,”\n",
      "      replied her uncle. “Your great men often are; and therefore I\n",
      "      shall not take him at his word, as he might change his mind\n",
      "      another day, and warn me off his grounds.”\n",
      "\n",
      "      Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his\n",
      "      character, but said nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "      “From what we have seen of him,” continued Mrs. Gardiner, “I\n",
      "      really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so\n",
      "      cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not\n",
      "      an ill-natured look. On the contrary, there is something pleasing\n",
      "      about his mouth when he speaks. And there is something of dignity\n",
      "      in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea\n",
      "      of his heart. But, to be sure, the good lady who showed us his\n",
      "      house did give him a most flaming character! I could hardly help\n",
      "      laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal master, I suppose,\n",
      "      and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue.”\n",
      "\n",
      "      Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in\n",

      "      to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that by what\n",
      "      she had heard from his relations in Kent, his actions were\n",
      "      capable of a very different construction; and that his character\n",
      "      was by no means so faulty, nor Wickham’s so amiable, as they had\n",
      "      been considered in Hertfordshire. In confirmation of this, she\n",

      "\n",
      "      She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she\n",

      "      such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made\n",

      "\n",
      "      Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable\n",
      "      introduction took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that\n",
      "      her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself.\n",
      "      Since her being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was\n",
      "      exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few minutes\n",
      "      convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy. She found it\n",
      "      difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable.\n",
      "\n",
      "      Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and,\n",
      "      though little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her\n",
      "      appearance womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her\n",
      "      brother; but there was sense and good humour in her face, and her\n",
      "      manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had\n",
      "      expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as\n",
      "      ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much relieved by discerning such\n",
      "      different feelings.\n",
      "\n",
      "      They had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that\n",
      "      Bingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time\n",
      "      to express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when\n",
      "      Bingley’s quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he\n",
      "      entered the room. All Elizabeth’s anger against him had been long\n",
      "      done away; but had she still felt any, it could hardly have stood\n",
      "      its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he\n",
      "      expressed himself on seeing her again. He enquired in a friendly,\n",
      "      though general way, after her family, and looked and spoke with\n",
      "      the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.\n",
      "\n",
      "      To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting\n",
      "      personage than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The\n",
      "      whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The\n",
      "      suspicions which had just arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece\n",
      "      directed their observation towards each with an earnest though\n",
      "      guarded enquiry; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full\n",
      "      conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love. Of\n",
      "      the lady’s sensations they remained a little in doubt; but that\n",
      "      the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "      Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain\n",
      "      the feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose her\n",
      "      own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter\n",

      "      eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.\n",
      "\n",
      "      In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister;\n",
      "      and, oh! how ardently did she long to know whether any of his\n",
      "      were directed in a like manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he\n",
      "      talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased\n",
      "      herself with the notion that, as he looked at her, he was trying\n",
      "      to trace a resemblance. But, though this might be imaginary, she\n",
      "      could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had\n",
      "      been set up as a rival to Jane. No look appeared on either side\n",
      "      that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred between them that\n",
      "      could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point she was soon\n",
      "      satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere\n",
      "      they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a\n",
      "      recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of\n",
      "      saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared.\n",
      "      He observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking\n",

      "      it “was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing\n",
      "      her;” and, before she could reply, he added, “It is above eight\n",
      "      months. We have not met since the 26th of November, when we were\n",
      "      all dancing together at Netherfield.”\n",
      "\n",
      "      Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he\n",
      "      afterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of\n",
      "      the rest, whether _all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was\n",
      "      not much in the question, nor in the preceding remark; but there\n",
      "      was a look and a manner which gave them meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "      It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy\n",
      "      himself; but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an\n",
      "      expression of general complaisance, and in all that he said she\n",
      "      heard an accent so removed from _hauteur_ or disdain of his\n",

      "      which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence\n",
      "      might prove, had at least outlived one day. When she saw him thus\n",

      "      the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected\n",
      "      their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage—the difference, the\n",
      "      change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she\n",
      "      could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never,\n",
      "      even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his\n",
      "      dignified relations at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to\n",
      "      please, so free from self-consequence or unbending reserve, as\n",

      "\n",
      "      Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing\n",

      "      favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.\n",
      "\n",
      "      But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s curiosity;\n",
      "      it was not their wish to force her communication. It was evident\n",
      "      that she was much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had\n",
      "      before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love\n",

      "there in that? Some aunts are tall, some aunts are not tall. That is a\n",
      "matter that surely an aunt may be allowed to decide for herself. You\n",

      "Yes. But why does your aunt call you her uncle? ‘From little Cecily,\n",

      "admit, to an aunt being a small aunt, but why an aunt, no matter what\n",

      "one as Ernest. You answer to the name of Ernest. You look as if your\n",
      "name was Ernest. You are the most earnest-looking person I ever saw in\n",
      "my life. It is perfectly absurd your saying that your name isn’t\n",

      "Yes, but that does not account for the fact that your small Aunt\n",

      "false impression.\n",
      "\n",
      "ALGERNON.\n",
      "Well, that is exactly what dentists always do. Now, go on! Tell me the\n",

      "Here it is. [Hands cigarette case.] Now produce your explanation, and\n",
      "pray make it improbable. [Sits on sofa.]\n",
      "\n",
      "JACK.\n",
      "My dear fellow, there is nothing improbable about my explanation at\n",
      "all. In fact it’s perfectly ordinary. Old Mr. Thomas Cardew, who\n",
      "adopted me when I was a little boy, made me in his will guardian to his\n",
      "grand-daughter, Miss Cecily Cardew. Cecily, who addresses me as her\n",
      "uncle from motives of respect that you could not possibly appreciate,\n",

      "Where is that place in the country, by the way?\n",
      "\n",
      "JACK.\n",
      "That is nothing to you, dear boy. You are not going to be invited . . .\n",
      "I may tell you candidly that the place is not in Shropshire.\n",
      "\n",
      "ALGERNON.\n",
      "I suspected that, my dear fellow! I have Bunburyed all over Shropshire\n",
      "on two separate occasions. Now, go on. Why are you Ernest in town and\n",
      "Jack in the country?\n",
      "\n",
      "JACK.\n",
      "My dear Algy, I don’t know whether you will be able to understand my\n",
      "real motives. You are hardly serious enough. When one is placed in the\n",
      "position of guardian, one has to adopt a very high moral tone on all\n",
      "subjects. It’s one’s duty to do so. And as a high moral tone can hardly\n",
      "be said to conduce very much to either one’s health or one’s happiness,\n",
      "in order to get up to town I have always pretended to have a younger\n",
      "brother of the name of Ernest, who lives in the Albany, and gets into\n",
      "the most dreadful scrapes. That, my dear Algy, is the whole truth pure\n",
      "and simple.\n",
      "\n",
      "ALGERNON.\n",
      "The truth is rarely pure and never simple. Modern life would be very\n",

      "ALGERNON.\n",
      "Literary criticism is not your forte, my dear fellow. Don’t try it. You\n",
      "should leave that to people who haven’t been at a University. They do\n",
      "it so well in the daily papers. What you really are is a Bunburyist. I\n",

      "Saturday who had been taken on Tuesday; now, burning people in the\n",

      "them and brought them to a stand, with a wary “Wo-ho! so-ho-then!” the\n",
      "near leader violently shook his head and everything upon it--like an\n",
      "unusually emphatic horse, denying that the coach could be got up the\n",
      "hill. Whenever the leader made this rattle, the passenger started, as a\n",

      "\n",
      "There was a steaming mist in all the hollows, and it had roamed in its\n",

      "air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another, as the\n",
      "waves of an unwholesome sea might do. It was dense enough to shut out\n",
      "everything from the light of the coach-lamps but these its own workings,\n",
      "and a few yards of road; and the reek of the labouring horses steamed\n",
      "into it, as if they had made it all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two other passengers, besides the one, were plodding up the hill by the\n",
      "side of the mail. All three were wrapped to the cheekbones and over the\n",
      "ears, and wore jack-boots. Not one of the three could have said, from\n",
      "anything he saw, what either of the other two was like; and each was\n",
      "hidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind, as from\n",
      "the eyes of the body, of his two companions. In those days, travellers\n",
      "were very shy of being confidential on a short notice, for anybody on\n",
      "the road might be a robber or in league with robbers. As to the latter,\n",
      "when every posting-house and ale-house could produce somebody in\n",

      "thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, lumbering up Shooter’s Hill, as\n",
      "he stood on his own particular perch behind the mail, beating his feet,\n",
      "and keeping an eye and a hand on the arm-chest before him, where a\n",
      "loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horse-pistols,\n",
      "deposited on a substratum of cutlass.\n",

      "The Dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected\n",
      "the passengers, the passengers suspected one another and the guard, they\n",
      "all suspected everybody else, and the coachman was sure of nothing but\n",
      "the horses; as to which cattle he could with a clear conscience have\n",
      "taken his oath on the two Testaments that they were not fit for the\n",
      "journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wo-ho!” said the coachman. “So, then! One more pull and you’re at the\n",
      "top and be damned to you, for I have had trouble enough to get you to\n",
      "it!--Joe!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Halloa!” the guard replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What o’clock do you make it, Joe?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ten minutes, good, past eleven.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The emphatic horse, cut short by the whip in a most decided negative,\n",
      "made a decided scramble for it, and the three other horses followed\n",
      "suit. Once more, the Dover mail struggled on, with the jack-boots of its\n",
      "passengers squashing along by its side. They had stopped when the coach\n",
      "stopped, and they kept close company with it. If any one of the three\n",
      "had had the hardihood to propose to another to walk on a little ahead\n",

      "\n",
      "The last burst carried the mail to the summit of the hill. The horses\n",

      "the descent, and open the coach-door to let the passengers in.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tst! Joe!” cried the coachman in a warning voice, looking down from his\n",

      "name, all of you!”\n",

      "in the road below him. They all looked from the coachman to the guard,\n",
      "and from the guard to the coachman, and listened. The coachman looked\n",
      "back and the guard looked back, and even the emphatic leader pricked up\n",
      "his ears and looked back, without contradicting.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and labouring\n",
      "of the coach, added to the stillness of the night, made it very quiet\n",
      "indeed. The panting of the horses communicated a tremulous motion to\n",
      "the coach, as if it were in a state of agitation. The hearts of the\n",
      "passengers beat loud enough perhaps to be heard; but at any rate, the\n",
      "quiet pause was audibly expressive of people out of breath, and holding\n",
      "the breath, and having the pulses quickened by expectation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sound of a horse at a gallop came fast and furiously up the hill.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So-ho!” the guard sang out, as loud as he could roar. “Yo there! Stand!\n",
      "I shall fire!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The pace was suddenly checked, and, with much splashing and floundering,\n",
      "a man’s voice called from the mist, “Is that the Dover mail?”\n",

      "\n",
      "“I hope there ain’t, but I can’t make so ‘Nation sure of that,” said the\n",

      "“Come on at a footpace! d’ye mind me? And if you’ve got holsters to that\n",
      "saddle o’ yourn, don’t let me see your hand go nigh ’em. For I’m a devil\n",
      "at a quick mistake, and when I make one it takes the form of Lead. So\n",
      "now let’s look at you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The figures of a horse and rider came slowly through the eddying mist,\n",
      "and came to the side of the mail, where the passenger stood. The rider\n",
      "stooped, and, casting up his eyes at the guard, handed the passenger\n",
      "a small folded paper. The rider’s horse was blown, and both horse and\n",
      "rider were covered with mud, from the hoofs of the horse to the hat of\n",
      "the man.\n",
      "\n",

      "their watches and purses in their boots, and were now making a general\n",

      "in his arm-chest, and, having looked to the rest of its contents, and\n",
      "having looked to the supplementary pistols that he wore in his belt,\n",
      "looked to a smaller chest beneath his seat, in which there were a\n",
      "few smith’s tools, a couple of torches, and a tinder-box. For he was\n",
      "furnished with that completeness that if the coach-lamps had been blown\n",
      "and stormed out, which did occasionally happen, he had only to shut\n",
      "himself up inside, keep the flint and steel sparks well off the straw,\n",
      "and get a light with tolerable safety and ease (if he were lucky) in\n",

      "defiance, stubbornness, submission, lamentation, succeeded one another;\n",

      "When the mail got successfully to Dover, in the course of the forenoon,\n",
      "the head drawer at the Royal George Hotel opened the coach-door as his\n",
      "custom was. He did it with some flourish of ceremony, for a mail journey\n",
      "from London in winter was an achievement to congratulate an adventurous\n",
      "traveller upon.\n",
      "\n",
      "By that time, there was only one adventurous traveller left be\n",
      "congratulated: for the two others had been set down at their respective\n",
      "roadside destinations. The mildewy inside of the coach, with its damp\n",
      "and dirty straw, its disagreeable smell, and its obscurity, was rather\n",
      "like a larger dog-kennel. Mr. Lorry, the passenger, shaking himself out\n",
      "of it in chains of straw, a tangle of shaggy wrapper, flapping hat, and\n",
      "muddy legs, was rather like a larger sort of dog.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There will be a packet to Calais, tomorrow, drawer?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, sir, if the weather holds and the wind sets tolerable fair. The\n",
      "tide will serve pretty nicely at about two in the afternoon, sir. Bed,\n",
      "sir?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shall not go to bed till night; but I want a bedroom, and a barber.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And then breakfast, sir? Yes, sir. That way, sir, if you please.\n",
      "Show Concord! Gentleman’s valise and hot water to Concord. Pull off\n",
      "gentleman’s boots in Concord. (You will find a fine sea-coal fire, sir.)\n",

      "\n",
      "The Concord bed-chamber being always assigned to a passenger by the\n",
      "mail, and passengers by the mail being always heavily wrapped up from\n",
      "head to foot, the room had the odd interest for the establishment of the\n",
      "Royal George, that although but one kind of man was seen to go into it,\n",
      "all kinds and varieties of men came out of it. Consequently, another\n",
      "drawer, and two porters, and several maids and the landlady, were all\n",
      "loitering by accident at various points of the road between the Concord\n",
      "and the coffee-room, when a gentleman of sixty, formally dressed in a\n",
      "brown suit of clothes, pretty well worn, but very well kept, with large\n",
      "square cuffs and large flaps to the pockets, passed along on his way to\n",
      "his breakfast.\n",
      "\n",
      "The coffee-room had no other occupant, that forenoon, than the gentleman\n",
      "in brown. His breakfast-table was drawn before the fire, and as he sat,\n",
      "with its light shining on him, waiting for the meal, he sat so still,\n",
      "that he might have been sitting for his portrait.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very orderly and methodical he looked, with a hand on each knee, and a\n",
      "loud watch ticking a sonorous sermon under his flapped waist-coat,\n",
      "as though it pitted its gravity and longevity against the levity and\n",
      "evanescence of the brisk fire. He had a good leg, and was a little vain\n",
      "of it, for his brown stockings fitted sleek and close, and were of a\n",
      "fine texture; his shoes and buckles, too, though plain, were trim. He\n",
      "wore an odd little sleek crisp flaxen wig, setting very close to his\n",
      "head: which wig, it is to be presumed, was made of hair, but which\n",
      "looked far more as though it were spun from filaments of silk or glass.\n",
      "His linen, though not of a fineness in accordance with his stockings,\n",
      "was as white as the tops of the waves that broke upon the neighbouring\n",
      "beach, or the specks of sail that glinted in the sunlight far at sea. A\n",
      "face habitually suppressed and quieted, was still lighted up under the\n",
      "quaint wig by a pair of moist bright eyes that it must have cost\n",
      "their owner, in years gone by, some pains to drill to the composed and\n",
      "reserved expression of Tellson’s Bank. He had a healthy colour in his\n",
      "cheeks, and his face, though lined, bore few traces of anxiety.\n",
      "But, perhaps the confidential bachelor clerks in Tellson’s Bank were\n",
      "principally occupied with the cares of other people; and perhaps\n",
      "second-hand cares, like second-hand clothes, come easily off and on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Completing his resemblance to a man who was sitting for his portrait,\n",
      "Mr. Lorry dropped off to sleep. The arrival of his breakfast roused him,\n",
      "and he said to the drawer, as he moved his chair to it:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wish accommodation prepared for a young lady who may come here at any\n",
      "time to-day. She may ask for Mr. Jarvis Lorry, or she may only ask for a\n",
      "gentleman from Tellson’s Bank. Please to let me know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, sir. Tellson’s Bank in London, sir?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, sir. We have oftentimes the honour to entertain your gentlemen in\n",
      "their travelling backwards and forwards betwixt London and Paris, sir. A\n",
      "vast deal of travelling, sir, in Tellson and Company’s House.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. We are quite a French House, as well as an English one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, sir. Not much in the habit of such travelling yourself, I think,\n",
      "sir?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not of late years. It is fifteen years since we--since I--came last\n",
      "from France.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed, sir? That was before my time here, sir. Before our people’s\n",
      "time here, sir. The George was in other hands at that time, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I believe so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I would hold a pretty wager, sir, that a House like Tellson and\n",
      "Company was flourishing, a matter of fifty, not to speak of fifteen\n",
      "years ago?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You might treble that, and say a hundred and fifty, yet not be far from\n",
      "the truth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed, sir!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Rounding his mouth and both his eyes, as he stepped backward from the\n",
      "table, the waiter shifted his napkin from his right arm to his left,\n",
      "dropped into a comfortable attitude, and stood surveying the guest while\n",
      "he ate and drank, as from an observatory or watchtower. According to the\n",
      "immemorial usage of waiters in all ages.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Mr. Lorry had finished his breakfast, he went out for a stroll on\n",
      "the beach. The little narrow, crooked town of Dover hid itself away\n",
      "from the beach, and ran its head into the chalk cliffs, like a marine\n",
      "ostrich. The beach was a desert of heaps of sea and stones tumbling\n",
      "wildly about, and the sea did what it liked, and what it liked was\n",
      "destruction. It thundered at the town, and thundered at the cliffs, and\n",
      "brought the coast down, madly. The air among the houses was of so strong\n",
      "a piscatory flavour that one might have supposed sick fish went up to be\n",
      "dipped in it, as sick people went down to be dipped in the sea. A little\n",
      "fishing was done in the port, and a quantity of strolling about by\n",
      "night, and looking seaward: particularly at those times when the tide\n",
      "made, and was near flood. Small tradesmen, who did no business whatever,\n",
      "sometimes unaccountably realised large fortunes, and it was remarkable\n",
      "that nobody in the neighbourhood could endure a lamplighter.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the day declined into the afternoon, and the air, which had been\n",
      "at intervals clear enough to allow the French coast to be seen, became\n",
      "again charged with mist and vapour, Mr. Lorry’s thoughts seemed to cloud\n",
      "too. When it was dark, and he sat before the coffee-room fire, awaiting\n",
      "his dinner as he had awaited his breakfast, his mind was busily digging,\n",
      "digging, digging, in the live red coals.\n",
      "\n",
      "A bottle of good claret after dinner does a digger in the red coals no\n",
      "harm, otherwise than as it has a tendency to throw him out of work.\n",
      "Mr. Lorry had been idle a long time, and had just poured out his last\n",
      "glassful of wine with as complete an appearance of satisfaction as is\n",
      "ever to be found in an elderly gentleman of a fresh complexion who has\n",
      "got to the end of a bottle, when a rattling of wheels came up the narrow\n",
      "street, and rumbled into the inn-yard.\n",
      "\n",
      "He set down his glass untouched. “This is Mam’selle!” said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a very few minutes the waiter came in to announce that Miss Manette\n",
      "had arrived from London, and would be happy to see the gentleman from\n",
      "Tellson’s.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So soon?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Manette had taken some refreshment on the road, and required none\n",
      "then, and was extremely anxious to see the gentleman from Tellson’s\n",
      "immediately, if it suited his pleasure and convenience.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gentleman from Tellson’s had nothing left for it but to empty his\n",
      "glass with an air of stolid desperation, settle his odd little flaxen\n",
      "wig at the ears, and follow the waiter to Miss Manette’s apartment.\n",
      "It was a large, dark room, furnished in a funereal manner with black\n",
      "horsehair, and loaded with heavy dark tables. These had been oiled and\n",
      "oiled, until the two tall candles on the table in the middle of the room\n",
      "were gloomily reflected on every leaf; as if _they_ were buried, in deep\n",
      "graves of black mahogany, and no light to speak of could be expected\n",
      "from them until they were dug out.\n",
      "\n",
      "The obscurity was so difficult to penetrate that Mr. Lorry, picking his\n",
      "way over the well-worn Turkey carpet, supposed Miss Manette to be, for\n",
      "the moment, in some adjacent room, until, having got past the two tall\n",
      "candles, he saw standing to receive him by the table between them and\n",
      "the fire, a young lady of not more than seventeen, in a riding-cloak,\n",
      "and still holding her straw travelling-hat by its ribbon in her hand. As\n",
      "his eyes rested on a short, slight, pretty figure, a quantity of golden\n",
      "hair, a pair of blue eyes that met his own with an inquiring look, and\n",
      "a forehead with a singular capacity (remembering how young and smooth\n",
      "it was), of rifting and knitting itself into an expression that was\n",
      "not quite one of perplexity, or wonder, or alarm, or merely of a bright\n",
      "fixed attention, though it included all the four expressions--as his\n",
      "eyes rested on these things, a sudden vivid likeness passed before him,\n",
      "of a child whom he had held in his arms on the passage across that very\n",
      "Channel, one cold time, when the hail drifted heavily and the sea ran\n",
      "high. The likeness passed away, like a breath along the surface of\n",
      "the gaunt pier-glass behind her, on the frame of which, a hospital\n",
      "procession of negro cupids, several headless and all cripples, were\n",
      "offering black baskets of Dead Sea fruit to black divinities of the\n",
      "feminine gender--and he made his formal bow to Miss Manette.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pray take a seat, sir.” In a very clear and pleasant young voice; a\n",
      "little foreign in its accent, but a very little indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I kiss your hand, miss,” said Mr. Lorry, with the manners of an earlier\n",
      "date, as he made his formal bow again, and took his seat.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I received a letter from the Bank, sir, yesterday, informing me that\n",
      "some intelligence--or discovery--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The word is not material, miss; either word will do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“--respecting the small property of my poor father, whom I never saw--so\n",
      "long dead--”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lorry moved in his chair, and cast a troubled look towards the\n",
      "hospital procession of negro cupids. As if _they_ had any help for\n",
      "anybody in their absurd baskets!\n",
      "\n",
      "“--rendered it necessary that I should go to Paris, there to communicate\n",
      "with a gentleman of the Bank, so good as to be despatched to Paris for\n",
      "the purpose.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Myself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“As I was prepared to hear, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She curtseyed to him (young ladies made curtseys in those days), with a\n",
      "pretty desire to convey to him that she felt how much older and wiser he\n",
      "was than she. He made her another bow.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I replied to the Bank, sir, that as it was considered necessary, by\n",
      "those who know, and who are so kind as to advise me, that I should go to\n",
      "France, and that as I am an orphan and have no friend who could go with\n",
      "me, I should esteem it highly if I might be permitted to place myself,\n",
      "during the journey, under that worthy gentleman’s protection. The\n",
      "gentleman had left London, but I think a messenger was sent after him to\n",
      "beg the favour of his waiting for me here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was happy,” said Mr. Lorry, “to be entrusted with the charge. I shall\n",
      "be more happy to execute it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sir, I thank you indeed. I thank you very gratefully. It was told me\n",
      "by the Bank that the gentleman would explain to me the details of the\n",
      "business, and that I must prepare myself to find them of a surprising\n",
      "nature. I have done my best to prepare myself, and I naturally have a\n",
      "strong and eager interest to know what they are.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Naturally,” said Mr. Lorry. “Yes--I--”\n",
      "\n",
      "After a pause, he added, again settling the crisp flaxen wig at the\n",
      "ears, “It is very difficult to begin.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not begin, but, in his indecision, met her glance. The young\n",
      "forehead lifted itself into that singular expression--but it was pretty\n",
      "and characteristic, besides being singular--and she raised her hand,\n",
      "as if with an involuntary action she caught at, or stayed some passing\n",
      "shadow.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you quite a stranger to me, sir?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Am I not?” Mr. Lorry opened his hands, and extended them outwards with\n",
      "an argumentative smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "Between the eyebrows and just over the little feminine nose, the line of\n",
      "which was as delicate and fine as it was possible to be, the expression\n",
      "deepened itself as she took her seat thoughtfully in the chair by which\n",
      "she had hitherto remained standing. He watched her as she mused, and the\n",
      "moment she raised her eyes again, went on:\n",
      "\n",
      "“In your adopted country, I presume, I cannot do better than address you\n",
      "as a young English lady, Miss Manette?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you please, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Manette, I am a man of business. I have a business charge to\n",
      "acquit myself of. In your reception of it, don’t heed me any more than\n",
      "if I was a speaking machine--truly, I am not much else. I will, with\n",
      "your leave, relate to you, miss, the story of one of our customers.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Story!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He seemed wilfully to mistake the word she had repeated, when he added,\n",
      "in a hurry, “Yes, customers; in the banking business we usually call\n",
      "our connection our customers. He was a French gentleman; a scientific\n",

      "\n",
      "“At that time--I may ask, at what time, sir?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I speak, miss, of twenty years ago. He married--an English lady--and\n",
      "I was one of the trustees. His affairs, like the affairs of many other\n",
      "French gentlemen and French families, were entirely in Tellson’s hands.\n",
      "In a similar way I am, or I have been, trustee of one kind or other for\n",
      "scores of our customers. These are mere business relations, miss;\n",
      "there is no friendship in them, no particular interest, nothing like\n",
      "sentiment. I have passed from one to another, in the course of my\n",
      "business life, just as I pass from one of our customers to another in\n",
      "the course of my business day; in short, I have no feelings; I am a mere\n",
      "machine. To go on--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But this is my father’s story, sir; and I begin to think”--the\n",

      "the chair-back with his left hand, and using his right by turns to rub\n",
      "his chin, pull his wig at the ears, or point what he said, stood looking\n",
      "down into her face while she sat looking up into his.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Manette, it _was_ I. And you will see how truly I spoke of myself\n",
      "just now, in saying I had no feelings, and that all the relations I hold\n",
      "with my fellow-creatures are mere business relations, when you reflect\n",
      "that I have never seen you since. No; you have been the ward of\n",
      "Tellson’s House since, and I have been busy with the other business of\n",
      "Tellson’s House since. Feelings! I have no time for them, no chance\n",
      "of them. I pass my whole life, miss, in turning an immense pecuniary\n",

      "\n",
      "After this odd description of his daily routine of employment, Mr. Lorry\n",
      "flattened his flaxen wig upon his head with both hands (which was most\n",

      "The Wine-shop\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A large cask of wine had been dropped and broken, in the street. The\n",
      "accident had happened in getting it out of a cart; the cask had tumbled\n",
      "out with a run, the hoops had burst, and it lay on the stones just\n",
      "outside the door of the wine-shop, shattered like a walnut-shell.\n",
      "\n",
      "All the people within reach had suspended their business, or their\n",
      "idleness, to run to the spot and drink the wine. The rough, irregular\n",
      "stones of the street, pointing every way, and designed, one might have\n",
      "thought, expressly to lame all living creatures that approached them,\n",
      "had dammed it into little pools; these were surrounded, each by its own\n",
      "jostling group or crowd, according to its size. Some men kneeled down,\n",
      "made scoops of their two hands joined, and sipped, or tried to help\n",
      "women, who bent over their shoulders, to sip, before the wine had all\n",
      "run out between their fingers. Others, men and women, dipped in\n",
      "the puddles with little mugs of mutilated earthenware, or even with\n",
      "handkerchiefs from women’s heads, which were squeezed dry into infants’\n",
      "mouths; others made small mud-embankments, to stem the wine as it ran;\n",
      "others, directed by lookers-on up at high windows, darted here and\n",
      "there, to cut off little streams of wine that started away in new\n",
      "directions; others devoted themselves to the sodden and lee-dyed\n",
      "pieces of the cask, licking, and even champing the moister wine-rotted\n",
      "fragments with eager relish. There was no drainage to carry off the\n",
      "wine, and not only did it all get taken up, but so much mud got taken up\n",
      "along with it, that there might have been a scavenger in the street,\n",
      "if anybody acquainted with it could have believed in such a miraculous\n",
      "presence.\n",
      "\n",
      "A shrill sound of laughter and of amused voices--voices of men, women,\n",
      "and children--resounded in the street while this wine game lasted. There\n",
      "was little roughness in the sport, and much playfulness. There was a\n",
      "special companionship in it, an observable inclination on the part\n",
      "of every one to join some other one, which led, especially among the\n",
      "luckier or lighter-hearted, to frolicsome embraces, drinking of healths,\n",
      "shaking of hands, and even joining of hands and dancing, a dozen\n",
      "together. When the wine was gone, and the places where it had been\n",
      "most abundant were raked into a gridiron-pattern by fingers, these\n",
      "demonstrations ceased, as suddenly as they had broken out. The man who\n",
      "had left his saw sticking in the firewood he was cutting, set it in\n",
      "motion again; the women who had left on a door-step the little pot of\n",
      "hot ashes, at which she had been trying to soften the pain in her own\n",
      "starved fingers and toes, or in those of her child, returned to it; men\n",
      "with bare arms, matted locks, and cadaverous faces, who had emerged into\n",
      "the winter light from cellars, moved away, to descend again; and a gloom\n",
      "gathered on the scene that appeared more natural to it than sunshine.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wine was red wine, and had stained the ground of the narrow street\n",
      "in the suburb of Saint Antoine, in Paris, where it was spilled. It had\n",
      "stained many hands, too, and many faces, and many naked feet, and many\n",
      "wooden shoes. The hands of the man who sawed the wood, left red marks\n",
      "on the billets; and the forehead of the woman who nursed her baby, was\n",
      "stained with the stain of the old rag she wound about her head again.\n",
      "Those who had been greedy with the staves of the cask, had acquired a\n",
      "tigerish smear about the mouth; and one tall joker so besmirched, his\n",
      "head more out of a long squalid bag of a nightcap than in it, scrawled\n",
      "upon a wall with his finger dipped in muddy wine-lees--BLOOD.\n",
      "\n",
      "The time was to come, when that wine too would be spilled on the\n",
      "street-stones, and when the stain of it would be red upon many there.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now that the cloud settled on Saint Antoine, which a momentary\n",
      "gleam had driven from his sacred countenance, the darkness of it was\n",
      "heavy--cold, dirt, sickness, ignorance, and want, were the lords in\n",
      "waiting on the saintly presence--nobles of great power all of them;\n",
      "but, most especially the last. Samples of a people that had undergone a\n",
      "terrible grinding and regrinding in the mill, and certainly not in the\n",
      "fabulous mill which ground old people young, shivered at every corner,\n",
      "passed in and out at every doorway, looked from every window, fluttered\n",
      "in every vestige of a garment that the wind shook. The mill which\n",
      "had worked them down, was the mill that grinds young people old; the\n",
      "children had ancient faces and grave voices; and upon them, and upon the\n",
      "grown faces, and ploughed into every furrow of age and coming up afresh,\n",
      "was the sigh, Hunger. It was prevalent everywhere. Hunger was pushed out\n",
      "of the tall houses, in the wretched clothing that hung upon poles and\n",
      "lines; Hunger was patched into them with straw and rag and wood and\n",
      "paper; Hunger was repeated in every fragment of the small modicum of\n",
      "firewood that the man sawed off; Hunger stared down from the smokeless\n",
      "chimneys, and started up from the filthy street that had no offal,\n",
      "among its refuse, of anything to eat. Hunger was the inscription on the\n",
      "baker’s shelves, written in every small loaf of his scanty stock of\n",
      "bad bread; at the sausage-shop, in every dead-dog preparation that\n",
      "was offered for sale. Hunger rattled its dry bones among the roasting\n",
      "chestnuts in the turned cylinder; Hunger was shred into atomics in every\n",
      "farthing porringer of husky chips of potato, fried with some reluctant\n",
      "drops of oil.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its abiding place was in all things fitted to it. A narrow winding\n",
      "street, full of offence and stench, with other narrow winding streets\n",
      "diverging, all peopled by rags and nightcaps, and all smelling of rags\n",
      "and nightcaps, and all visible things with a brooding look upon them\n",
      "that looked ill. In the hunted air of the people there was yet some\n",
      "wild-beast thought of the possibility of turning at bay. Depressed and\n",
      "slinking though they were, eyes of fire were not wanting among them; nor\n",
      "compressed lips, white with what they suppressed; nor foreheads knitted\n",
      "into the likeness of the gallows-rope they mused about enduring, or\n",
      "inflicting. The trade signs (and they were almost as many as the shops)\n",
      "were, all, grim illustrations of Want. The butcher and the porkman\n",
      "painted up, only the leanest scrags of meat; the baker, the coarsest of\n",
      "meagre loaves. The people rudely pictured as drinking in the wine-shops,\n",
      "croaked over their scanty measures of thin wine and beer, and were\n",
      "gloweringly confidential together. Nothing was represented in a\n",
      "flourishing condition, save tools and weapons; but, the cutler’s knives\n",
      "and axes were sharp and bright, the smith’s hammers were heavy, and the\n",
      "gunmaker’s stock was murderous. The crippling stones of the pavement,\n",
      "with their many little reservoirs of mud and water, had no footways, but\n",
      "broke off abruptly at the doors. The kennel, to make amends, ran down\n",
      "the middle of the street--when it ran at all: which was only after heavy\n",
      "rains, and then it ran, by many eccentric fits, into the houses. Across\n",
      "the streets, at wide intervals, one clumsy lamp was slung by a rope and\n",
      "pulley; at night, when the lamplighter had let these down, and lighted,\n",
      "and hoisted them again, a feeble grove of dim wicks swung in a sickly\n",
      "manner overhead, as if they were at sea. Indeed they were at sea, and\n",
      "the ship and crew were in peril of tempest.\n",
      "\n",
      "For, the time was to come, when the gaunt scarecrows of that region\n",
      "should have watched the lamplighter, in their idleness and hunger, so\n",
      "long, as to conceive the idea of improving on his method, and hauling\n",
      "up men by those ropes and pulleys, to flare upon the darkness of their\n",
      "condition. But, the time was not come yet; and every wind that blew over\n",
      "France shook the rags of the scarecrows in vain, for the birds, fine of\n",
      "song and feather, took no warning.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wine-shop was a corner shop, better than most others in its\n",
      "appearance and degree, and the master of the wine-shop had stood outside\n",
      "it, in a yellow waistcoat and green breeches, looking on at the struggle\n",
      "for the lost wine. “It’s not my affair,” said he, with a final shrug\n",
      "of the shoulders. “The people from the market did it. Let them bring\n",
      "another.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There, his eyes happening to catch the tall joker writing up his joke,\n",
      "he called to him across the way:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Say, then, my Gaspard, what do you do there?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The fellow pointed to his joke with immense significance, as is often\n",
      "the way with his tribe. It missed its mark, and completely failed, as is\n",
      "often the way with his tribe too.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What now? Are you a subject for the mad hospital?” said the wine-shop\n",
      "keeper, crossing the road, and obliterating the jest with a handful of\n",
      "mud, picked up for the purpose, and smeared over it. “Why do you write\n",
      "in the public streets? Is there--tell me thou--is there no other place\n",
      "to write such words in?”\n",
      "\n",
      "In his expostulation he dropped his cleaner hand (perhaps accidentally,\n",
      "perhaps not) upon the joker’s heart. The joker rapped it with his\n",
      "own, took a nimble spring upward, and came down in a fantastic dancing\n",
      "attitude, with one of his stained shoes jerked off his foot into his\n",
      "hand, and held out. A joker of an extremely, not to say wolfishly\n",
      "practical character, he looked, under those circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Put it on, put it on,” said the other. “Call wine, wine; and finish\n",
      "there.” With that advice, he wiped his soiled hand upon the joker’s\n",
      "dress, such as it was--quite deliberately, as having dirtied the hand on\n",
      "his account; and then recrossed the road and entered the wine-shop.\n",
      "\n",
      "This wine-shop keeper was a bull-necked, martial-looking man of thirty,\n",
      "and he should have been of a hot temperament, for, although it was a\n",
      "bitter day, he wore no coat, but carried one slung over his shoulder.\n",
      "His shirt-sleeves were rolled up, too, and his brown arms were bare to\n",
      "the elbows. Neither did he wear anything more on his head than his own\n",
      "crisply-curling short dark hair. He was a dark man altogether, with good\n",
      "eyes and a good bold breadth between them. Good-humoured looking on\n",
      "the whole, but implacable-looking, too; evidently a man of a strong\n",
      "resolution and a set purpose; a man not desirable to be met, rushing\n",
      "down a narrow pass with a gulf on either side, for nothing would turn\n",
      "the man.\n",

      "Madame Defarge, his wife, sat in the shop behind the counter as he\n",

      "a watchful eye that seldom seemed to look at anything, a large hand\n",
      "heavily ringed, a steady face, strong features, and great composure of\n",

      "have predicated that she did not often make mistakes against herself\n",
      "in any of the reckonings over which she presided. Madame Defarge being\n",
      "sensitive to cold, was wrapped in fur, and had a quantity of bright\n",
      "shawl twined about her head, though not to the concealment of her large\n",
      "earrings. Her knitting was before her, but she had laid it down to pick\n",

      "by her left hand, Madame Defarge said nothing when her lord came in, but\n",
      "coughed just one grain of cough. This, in combination with the lifting\n",
      "of her darkly defined eyebrows over her toothpick by the breadth of a\n",
      "line, suggested to her husband that he would do well to look round the\n",

      "rested upon an elderly gentleman and a young lady, who were seated in\n",
      "a corner. Other company were there: two playing cards, two playing\n",
      "dominoes, three standing by the counter lengthening out a short supply\n",
      "of wine. As he passed behind the counter, he took notice that the\n",
      "elderly gentleman said in a look to the young lady, “This is our man.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What the devil do _you_ do in that galley there?” said Monsieur Defarge\n",
      "to himself; “I don’t know you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But, he feigned not to notice the two strangers, and fell into discourse\n",
      "with the triumvirate of customers who were drinking at the counter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How goes it, Jacques?” said one of these three to Monsieur Defarge. “Is\n",

      "\n",
      "When this interchange of Christian name was effected, Madame Defarge,\n",
      "picking her teeth with her toothpick, coughed another grain of cough,\n",
      "and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is not often,” said the second of the three, addressing Monsieur\n",
      "Defarge, “that many of these miserable beasts know the taste of wine, or\n",
      "of anything but black bread and death. Is it not so, Jacques?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is so, Jacques,” Monsieur Defarge returned.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this second interchange of the Christian name, Madame Defarge, still\n",
      "using her toothpick with profound composure, coughed another grain of\n",
      "cough, and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last of the three now said his say, as he put down his empty\n",
      "drinking vessel and smacked his lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! So much the worse! A bitter taste it is that such poor cattle\n",
      "always have in their mouths, and hard lives they live, Jacques. Am I\n",
      "right, Jacques?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are right, Jacques,” was the response of Monsieur Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "This third interchange of the Christian name was completed at the moment\n",
      "when Madame Defarge put her toothpick by, kept her eyebrows up, and\n",
      "slightly rustled in her seat.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hold then! True!” muttered her husband. “Gentlemen--my wife!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The three customers pulled off their hats to Madame Defarge, with three\n",
      "flourishes. She acknowledged their homage by bending her head, and\n",
      "giving them a quick look. Then she glanced in a casual manner round the\n",
      "wine-shop, took up her knitting with great apparent calmness and repose\n",
      "of spirit, and became absorbed in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gentlemen,” said her husband, who had kept his bright eye observantly\n",
      "upon her, “good day. The chamber, furnished bachelor-fashion, that you\n",
      "wished to see, and were inquiring for when I stepped out, is on the\n",
      "fifth floor. The doorway of the staircase gives on the little courtyard\n",
      "close to the left here,” pointing with his hand, “near to the window of\n",
      "my establishment. But, now that I remember, one of you has already been\n",
      "there, and can show the way. Gentlemen, adieu!”\n",
      "\n",
      "They paid for their wine, and left the place. The eyes of Monsieur\n",
      "Defarge were studying his wife at her knitting when the elderly\n",
      "gentleman advanced from his corner, and begged the favour of a word.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Willingly, sir,” said Monsieur Defarge, and quietly stepped with him to\n",
      "the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their conference was very short, but very decided. Almost at the first\n",
      "word, Monsieur Defarge started and became deeply attentive. It had\n",
      "not lasted a minute, when he nodded and went out. The gentleman then\n",
      "beckoned to the young lady, and they, too, went out. Madame Defarge\n",
      "knitted with nimble fingers and steady eyebrows, and saw nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Jarvis Lorry and Miss Manette, emerging from the wine-shop thus,\n",
      "joined Monsieur Defarge in the doorway to which he had directed his own\n",
      "company just before. It opened from a stinking little black courtyard,\n",
      "and was the general public entrance to a great pile of houses, inhabited\n",
      "by a great number of people. In the gloomy tile-paved entry to the\n",
      "gloomy tile-paved staircase, Monsieur Defarge bent down on one knee\n",
      "to the child of his old master, and put her hand to his lips. It was\n",
      "a gentle action, but not at all gently done; a very remarkable\n",
      "transformation had come over him in a few seconds. He had no good-humour\n",
      "in his face, nor any openness of aspect left, but had become a secret,\n",
      "angry, dangerous man.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is very high; it is a little difficult. Better to begin slowly.”\n",
      " Thus, Monsieur Defarge, in a stern voice, to Mr. Lorry, as they began\n",
      "ascending the stairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is he alone?” the latter whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Alone! God help him, who should be with him!” said the other, in the\n",
      "same low voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is he always alone, then?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of his own desire?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of his own necessity. As he was, when I first saw him after they\n",
      "found me and demanded to know if I would take him, and, at my peril be\n",
      "discreet--as he was then, so he is now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He is greatly changed?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Changed!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The keeper of the wine-shop stopped to strike the wall with his hand,\n",
      "and mutter a tremendous curse. No direct answer could have been half so\n",
      "forcible. Mr. Lorry’s spirits grew heavier and heavier, as he and his\n",
      "two companions ascended higher and higher.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such a staircase, with its accessories, in the older and more crowded\n",
      "parts of Paris, would be bad enough now; but, at that time, it was vile\n",
      "indeed to unaccustomed and unhardened senses. Every little habitation\n",
      "within the great foul nest of one high building--that is to say,\n",
      "the room or rooms within every door that opened on the general\n",
      "staircase--left its own heap of refuse on its own landing, besides\n",
      "flinging other refuse from its own windows. The uncontrollable and\n",
      "hopeless mass of decomposition so engendered, would have polluted\n",
      "the air, even if poverty and deprivation had not loaded it with their\n",
      "intangible impurities; the two bad sources combined made it almost\n",
      "insupportable. Through such an atmosphere, by a steep dark shaft of dirt\n",
      "and poison, the way lay. Yielding to his own disturbance of mind, and to\n",
      "his young companion’s agitation, which became greater every instant, Mr.\n",
      "Jarvis Lorry twice stopped to rest. Each of these stoppages was made\n",
      "at a doleful grating, by which any languishing good airs that were left\n",
      "uncorrupted, seemed to escape, and all spoilt and sickly vapours seemed\n",
      "to crawl in. Through the rusted bars, tastes, rather than glimpses, were\n",
      "caught of the jumbled neighbourhood; and nothing within range, nearer\n",
      "or lower than the summits of the two great towers of Notre-Dame, had any\n",
      "promise on it of healthy life or wholesome aspirations.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last, the top of the staircase was gained, and they stopped for the\n",
      "third time. There was yet an upper staircase, of a steeper inclination\n",
      "and of contracted dimensions, to be ascended, before the garret story\n",
      "was reached. The keeper of the wine-shop, always going a little in\n",
      "advance, and always going on the side which Mr. Lorry took, as though he\n",
      "dreaded to be asked any question by the young lady, turned himself about\n",
      "here, and, carefully feeling in the pockets of the coat he carried over\n",
      "his shoulder, took out a key.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The door is locked then, my friend?” said Mr. Lorry, surprised.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ay. Yes,” was the grim reply of Monsieur Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You think it necessary to keep the unfortunate gentleman so retired?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think it necessary to turn the key.” Monsieur Defarge whispered it\n",
      "closer in his ear, and frowned heavily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why! Because he has lived so long, locked up, that he would be\n",
      "frightened--rave--tear himself to pieces--die--come to I know not what\n",
      "harm--if his door was left open.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is it possible!” exclaimed Mr. Lorry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is it possible!” repeated Defarge, bitterly. “Yes. And a beautiful\n",
      "world we live in, when it _is_ possible, and when many other such things\n",
      "are possible, and not only possible, but done--done, see you!--under\n",
      "that sky there, every day. Long live the Devil. Let us go on.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This dialogue had been held in so very low a whisper, that not a word\n",
      "of it had reached the young lady’s ears. But, by this time she trembled\n",
      "under such strong emotion, and her face expressed such deep anxiety,\n",
      "and, above all, such dread and terror, that Mr. Lorry felt it incumbent\n",
      "on him to speak a word or two of reassurance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Courage, dear miss! Courage! Business! The worst will be over in a\n",
      "moment; it is but passing the room-door, and the worst is over. Then,\n",
      "all the good you bring to him, all the relief, all the happiness you\n",
      "bring to him, begin. Let our good friend here, assist you on that side.\n",
      "That’s well, friend Defarge. Come, now. Business, business!”\n",
      "\n",
      "They went up slowly and softly. The staircase was short, and they were\n",
      "soon at the top. There, as it had an abrupt turn in it, they came all at\n",
      "once in sight of three men, whose heads were bent down close together at\n",
      "the side of a door, and who were intently looking into the room to which\n",
      "the door belonged, through some chinks or holes in the wall. On hearing\n",
      "footsteps close at hand, these three turned, and rose, and showed\n",
      "themselves to be the three of one name who had been drinking in the\n",
      "wine-shop.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I forgot them in the surprise of your visit,” explained Monsieur\n",
      "Defarge. “Leave us, good boys; we have business here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The three glided by, and went silently down.\n",
      "\n",
      "There appearing to be no other door on that floor, and the keeper of\n",
      "the wine-shop going straight to this one when they were left alone, Mr.\n",
      "Lorry asked him in a whisper, with a little anger:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you make a show of Monsieur Manette?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I show him, in the way you have seen, to a chosen few.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is that well?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_I_ think it is well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who are the few? How do you choose them?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I choose them as real men, of my name--Jacques is my name--to whom the\n",
      "sight is likely to do good. Enough; you are English; that is another\n",
      "thing. Stay there, if you please, a little moment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With an admonitory gesture to keep them back, he stooped, and looked in\n",
      "through the crevice in the wall. Soon raising his head again, he struck\n",
      "twice or thrice upon the door--evidently with no other object than to\n",
      "make a noise there. With the same intention, he drew the key across it,\n",
      "three or four times, before he put it clumsily into the lock, and turned\n",
      "it as heavily as he could.\n",
      "\n",
      "The door slowly opened inward under his hand, and he looked into the\n",
      "room and said something. A faint voice answered something. Little more\n",
      "than a single syllable could have been spoken on either side.\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked back over his shoulder, and beckoned them to enter. Mr. Lorry\n",
      "got his arm securely round the daughter’s waist, and held her; for he\n",
      "felt that she was sinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A-a-a-business, business!” he urged, with a moisture that was not of\n",
      "business shining on his cheek. “Come in, come in!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am afraid of it,” she answered, shuddering.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of it? What?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I mean of him. Of my father.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Rendered in a manner desperate, by her state and by the beckoning of\n",
      "their conductor, he drew over his neck the arm that shook upon his\n",
      "shoulder, lifted her a little, and hurried her into the room. He sat her\n",
      "down just within the door, and held her, clinging to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Defarge drew out the key, closed the door, locked it on the inside,\n",
      "took out the key again, and held it in his hand. All this he did,\n",
      "methodically, and with as loud and harsh an accompaniment of noise as he\n",
      "could make. Finally, he walked across the room with a measured tread to\n",
      "where the window was. He stopped there, and faced round.\n",
      "\n",
      "The garret, built to be a depository for firewood and the like, was dim\n",
      "and dark: for, the window of dormer shape, was in truth a door in the\n",
      "roof, with a little crane over it for the hoisting up of stores from\n",
      "the street: unglazed, and closing up the middle in two pieces, like any\n",
      "other door of French construction. To exclude the cold, one half of this\n",
      "door was fast closed, and the other was opened but a very little way.\n",
      "Such a scanty portion of light was admitted through these means, that it\n",
      "was difficult, on first coming in, to see anything; and long habit\n",
      "alone could have slowly formed in any one, the ability to do any work\n",
      "requiring nicety in such obscurity. Yet, work of that kind was being\n",
      "done in the garret; for, with his back towards the door, and his face\n",
      "towards the window where the keeper of the wine-shop stood looking at\n",
      "him, a white-haired man sat on a low bench, stooping forward and very\n",
      "busy, making shoes.\n",

      "CHAPTER VI.\n",
      "The Shoemaker\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good day!” said Monsieur Defarge, looking down at the white head that\n",
      "bent low over the shoemaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was raised for a moment, and a very faint voice responded to the\n",
      "salutation, as if it were at a distance:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good day!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are still hard at work, I see?”\n",
      "\n",
      "After a long silence, the head was lifted for another moment, and the\n",
      "voice replied, “Yes--I am working.” This time, a pair of haggard eyes\n",
      "had looked at the questioner, before the face had dropped again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The faintness of the voice was pitiable and dreadful. It was not the\n",
      "faintness of physical weakness, though confinement and hard fare no\n",
      "doubt had their part in it. Its deplorable peculiarity was, that it was\n",
      "the faintness of solitude and disuse. It was like the last feeble echo\n",
      "of a sound made long and long ago. So entirely had it lost the life and\n",
      "resonance of the human voice, that it affected the senses like a once\n",
      "beautiful colour faded away into a poor weak stain. So sunken and\n",
      "suppressed it was, that it was like a voice underground. So expressive\n",
      "it was, of a hopeless and lost creature, that a famished traveller,\n",
      "wearied out by lonely wandering in a wilderness, would have remembered\n",
      "home and friends in such a tone before lying down to die.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some minutes of silent work had passed: and the haggard eyes had looked\n",
      "up again: not with any interest or curiosity, but with a dull mechanical\n",
      "perception, beforehand, that the spot where the only visitor they were\n",
      "aware of had stood, was not yet empty.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I want,” said Defarge, who had not removed his gaze from the shoemaker,\n",
      "“to let in a little more light here. You can bear a little more?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The shoemaker stopped his work; looked with a vacant air of listening,\n",
      "at the floor on one side of him; then similarly, at the floor on the\n",
      "other side of him; then, upward at the speaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What did you say?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You can bear a little more light?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I must bear it, if you let it in.” (Laying the palest shadow of a\n",
      "stress upon the second word.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The opened half-door was opened a little further, and secured at that\n",
      "angle for the time. A broad ray of light fell into the garret, and\n",
      "showed the workman with an unfinished shoe upon his lap, pausing in his\n",
      "labour. His few common tools and various scraps of leather were at his\n",
      "feet and on his bench. He had a white beard, raggedly cut, but not very\n",
      "long, a hollow face, and exceedingly bright eyes. The hollowness and\n",
      "thinness of his face would have caused them to look large, under his yet\n",
      "dark eyebrows and his confused white hair, though they had been really\n",
      "otherwise; but, they were naturally large, and looked unnaturally so.\n",
      "His yellow rags of shirt lay open at the throat, and showed his body\n",
      "to be withered and worn. He, and his old canvas frock, and his loose\n",
      "stockings, and all his poor tatters of clothes, had, in a long seclusion\n",
      "from direct light and air, faded down to such a dull uniformity of\n",
      "parchment-yellow, that it would have been hard to say which was which.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had put up a hand between his eyes and the light, and the very bones\n",
      "of it seemed transparent. So he sat, with a steadfastly vacant gaze,\n",
      "pausing in his work. He never looked at the figure before him, without\n",
      "first looking down on this side of himself, then on that, as if he had\n",
      "lost the habit of associating place with sound; he never spoke, without\n",
      "first wandering in this manner, and forgetting to speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you going to finish that pair of shoes to-day?” asked Defarge,\n",
      "motioning to Mr. Lorry to come forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What did you say?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you mean to finish that pair of shoes to-day?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can’t say that I mean to. I suppose so. I don’t know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But, the question reminded him of his work, and he bent over it again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lorry came silently forward, leaving the daughter by the door. When\n",
      "he had stood, for a minute or two, by the side of Defarge, the shoemaker\n",
      "looked up. He showed no surprise at seeing another figure, but the\n",
      "unsteady fingers of one of his hands strayed to his lips as he looked at\n",
      "it (his lips and his nails were of the same pale lead-colour), and then\n",
      "the hand dropped to his work, and he once more bent over the shoe. The\n",
      "look and the action had occupied but an instant.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have a visitor, you see,” said Monsieur Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What did you say?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here is a visitor.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The shoemaker looked up as before, but without removing a hand from his\n",
      "work.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come!” said Defarge. “Here is monsieur, who knows a well-made shoe when\n",
      "he sees one. Show him that shoe you are working at. Take it, monsieur.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lorry took it in his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tell monsieur what kind of shoe it is, and the maker’s name.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a longer pause than usual, before the shoemaker replied:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I forget what it was you asked me. What did you say?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I said, couldn’t you describe the kind of shoe, for monsieur’s\n",
      "information?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is a lady’s shoe. It is a young lady’s walking-shoe. It is in the\n",
      "present mode. I never saw the mode. I have had a pattern in my hand.” He\n",
      "glanced at the shoe with some little passing touch of pride.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And the maker’s name?” said Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that he had no work to hold, he laid the knuckles of the right hand\n",
      "in the hollow of the left, and then the knuckles of the left hand in the\n",
      "hollow of the right, and then passed a hand across his bearded chin, and\n",
      "so on in regular changes, without a moment’s intermission. The task of\n",
      "recalling him from the vagrancy into which he always sank when he\n",

      "from which they had wandered; when they rested on it, he started, and\n",
      "resumed, in the manner of a sleeper that moment awake, reverting to a\n",
      "subject of last night.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I asked leave to teach myself, and I got it with much difficulty after\n",

      "\n",
      "“Monsieur Manette”; Mr. Lorry laid his hand upon Defarge’s arm; “do you\n",

      "Lorry and at Defarge, some long obliterated marks of an actively intent\n",
      "intelligence in the middle of the forehead, gradually forced themselves\n",
      "through the black mist that had fallen on him. They were overclouded\n",
      "again, they were fainter, they were gone; but they had been there. And\n",
      "so exactly was the expression repeated on the fair young face of her who\n",
      "had crept along the wall to a point where she could see him, and where\n",
      "she now stood looking at him, with hands which at first had been only\n",
      "raised in frightened compassion, if not even to keep him off and\n",
      "shut out the sight of him, but which were now extending towards him,\n",
      "trembling with eagerness to lay the spectral face upon her warm young\n",
      "breast, and love it back to life and hope--so exactly was the expression\n",
      "repeated (though in stronger characters) on her fair young face, that it\n",
      "looked as though it had passed like a moving light, from him to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Darkness had fallen on him in its place. He looked at the two, less and\n",
      "less attentively, and his eyes in gloomy abstraction sought the ground\n",
      "and looked about him in the old way. Finally, with a deep long sigh, he\n",
      "took the shoe up, and resumed his work.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you recognised him, monsieur?” asked Defarge in a whisper.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes; for a moment. At first I thought it quite hopeless, but I have\n",

      "over his labour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not a word was spoken, not a sound was made. She stood, like a spirit,\n",
      "beside him, and he bent over his work.\n",
      "\n",
      "It happened, at length, that he had occasion to change the instrument\n",
      "in his hand, for his shoemaker’s knife. It lay on that side of him\n",
      "which was not the side on which she stood. He had taken it up, and was\n",
      "stooping to work again, when his eyes caught the skirt of her dress. He\n",
      "raised them, and saw her face. The two spectators started forward,\n",
      "but she stayed them with a motion of her hand. She had no fear of his\n",
      "striking at her with the knife, though they had.\n",
      "\n",
      "He stared at her with a fearful look, and after a while his lips began\n",
      "to form some words, though no sound proceeded from them. By degrees, in\n",
      "the pauses of his quick and laboured breathing, he was heard to say:\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is this?”\n",
      "\n",
      "With the tears streaming down her face, she put her two hands to her\n",
      "lips, and kissed them to him; then clasped them on her breast, as if she\n",
      "laid his ruined head there.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are not the gaoler’s daughter?”\n",
      "\n",

      "“Who are you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Not yet trusting the tones of her voice, she sat down on the bench\n",
      "beside him. He recoiled, but she laid her hand upon his arm. A strange\n",
      "thrill struck him when she did so, and visibly passed over his frame; he\n",
      "laid the knife down softly, as he sat staring at her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her golden hair, which she wore in long curls, had been hurriedly pushed\n",
      "aside, and fell down over her neck. Advancing his hand by little and\n",
      "little, he took it up and looked at it. In the midst of the action\n",
      "he went astray, and, with another deep sigh, fell to work at his\n",
      "shoemaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "But not for long. Releasing his arm, she laid her hand upon his\n",
      "shoulder. After looking doubtfully at it, two or three times, as if to\n",
      "be sure that it was really there, he laid down his work, put his hand\n",
      "to his neck, and took off a blackened string with a scrap of folded rag\n",
      "attached to it. He opened this, carefully, on his knee, and it contained\n",
      "a very little quantity of hair: not more than one or two long golden\n",
      "hairs, which he had, in some old day, wound off upon his finger.\n",
      "\n",
      "He took her hair into his hand again, and looked closely at it. “It is\n",
      "the same. How can it be! When was it! How was it!”\n",
      "\n",
      "As the concentrated expression returned to his forehead, he seemed to\n",
      "become conscious that it was in hers too. He turned her full to the\n",
      "light, and looked at her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She had laid her head upon my shoulder, that night when I was summoned\n",
      "out--she had a fear of my going, though I had none--and when I was\n",
      "brought to the North Tower they found these upon my sleeve. ‘You will\n",
      "leave me them? They can never help me to escape in the body, though they\n",
      "may in the spirit.’ Those were the words I said. I remember them very\n",
      "well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He formed this speech with his lips many times before he could utter it.\n",
      "But when he did find spoken words for it, they came to him coherently,\n",
      "though slowly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How was this?--_Was it you_?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Once more, the two spectators started, as he turned upon her with a\n",
      "frightful suddenness. But she sat perfectly still in his grasp, and only\n",
      "said, in a low voice, “I entreat you, good gentlemen, do not come near\n",
      "us, do not speak, do not move!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hark!” he exclaimed. “Whose voice was that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "His hands released her as he uttered this cry, and went up to his white\n",
      "hair, which they tore in a frenzy. It died out, as everything but his\n",
      "shoemaking did die out of him, and he refolded his little packet and\n",
      "tried to secure it in his breast; but he still looked at her, and\n",
      "gloomily shook his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, no, no; you are too young, too blooming. It can’t be. See what the\n",
      "prisoner is. These are not the hands she knew, this is not the face\n",
      "she knew, this is not a voice she ever heard. No, no. She was--and He\n",
      "was--before the slow years of the North Tower--ages ago. What is your\n",
      "name, my gentle angel?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Hailing his softened tone and manner, his daughter fell upon her knees\n",
      "before him, with her appealing hands upon his breast.\n",
      "\n",
      "“O, sir, at another time you shall know my name, and who my mother was,\n",
      "and who my father, and how I never knew their hard, hard history. But I\n",
      "cannot tell you at this time, and I cannot tell you here. All that I may\n",
      "tell you, here and now, is, that I pray to you to touch me and to bless\n",
      "me. Kiss me, kiss me! O my dear, my dear!”\n",
      "\n",
      "His cold white head mingled with her radiant hair, which warmed and\n",
      "lighted it as though it were the light of Freedom shining on him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you hear in my voice--I don’t know that it is so, but I hope it\n",
      "is--if you hear in my voice any resemblance to a voice that once was\n",
      "sweet music in your ears, weep for it, weep for it! If you touch, in\n",
      "touching my hair, anything that recalls a beloved head that lay on your\n",
      "breast when you were young and free, weep for it, weep for it! If, when\n",
      "I hint to you of a Home that is before us, where I will be true to you\n",
      "with all my duty and with all my faithful service, I bring back the\n",
      "remembrance of a Home long desolate, while your poor heart pined away,\n",
      "weep for it, weep for it!”\n",
      "\n",
      "She held him closer round the neck, and rocked him on her breast like a\n",
      "child.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If, when I tell you, dearest dear, that your agony is over, and that I\n",
      "have come here to take you from it, and that we go to England to be at\n",
      "peace and at rest, I cause you to think of your useful life laid waste,\n",
      "and of our native France so wicked to you, weep for it, weep for it! And\n",
      "if, when I shall tell you of my name, and of my father who is living,\n",
      "and of my mother who is dead, you learn that I have to kneel to my\n",
      "honoured father, and implore his pardon for having never for his sake\n",
      "striven all day and lain awake and wept all night, because the love of\n",
      "my poor mother hid his torture from me, weep for it, weep for it! Weep\n",
      "for her, then, and for me! Good gentlemen, thank God! I feel his sacred\n",

      "\n",
      "He had sunk in her arms, and his face dropped on her breast: a sight so\n",
      "touching, yet so terrible in the tremendous wrong and suffering which\n",
      "had gone before it, that the two beholders covered their faces.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the quiet of the garret had been long undisturbed, and his heaving\n",
      "breast and shaken form had long yielded to the calm that must follow all\n",
      "storms--emblem to humanity, of the rest and silence into which the storm\n",
      "called Life must hush at last--they came forward to raise the father and\n",
      "daughter from the ground. He had gradually dropped to the floor, and lay\n",
      "there in a lethargy, worn out. She had nestled down with him, that his\n",
      "head might lie upon her arm; and her hair drooping over him curtained\n",
      "him from the light.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If, without disturbing him,” she said, raising her hand to Mr. Lorry as\n",
      "he stooped over them, after repeated blowings of his nose, “all could be\n",
      "arranged for our leaving Paris at once, so that, from the very door, he\n",
      "could be taken away--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, consider. Is he fit for the journey?” asked Mr. Lorry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“More fit for that, I think, than to remain in this city, so dreadful to\n",
      "him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is true,” said Defarge, who was kneeling to look on and hear. “More\n",
      "than that; Monsieur Manette is, for all reasons, best out of France.\n",
      "Say, shall I hire a carriage and post-horses?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s business,” said Mr. Lorry, resuming on the shortest notice his\n",
      "methodical manners; “and if business is to be done, I had better do it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then be so kind,” urged Miss Manette, “as to leave us here. You see how\n",
      "composed he has become, and you cannot be afraid to leave him with me\n",
      "now. Why should you be? If you will lock the door to secure us from\n",
      "interruption, I do not doubt that you will find him, when you come back,\n",
      "as quiet as you leave him. In any case, I will take care of him until\n",
      "you return, and then we will remove him straight.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Both Mr. Lorry and Defarge were rather disinclined to this course, and\n",
      "in favour of one of them remaining. But, as there were not only carriage\n",
      "and horses to be seen to, but travelling papers; and as time pressed,\n",
      "for the day was drawing to an end, it came at last to their hastily\n",
      "dividing the business that was necessary to be done, and hurrying away\n",
      "to do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, as the darkness closed in, the daughter laid her head down on the\n",
      "hard ground close at the father’s side, and watched him. The darkness\n",
      "deepened and deepened, and they both lay quiet, until a light gleamed\n",
      "through the chinks in the wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lorry and Monsieur Defarge had made all ready for the journey, and\n",
      "had brought with them, besides travelling cloaks and wrappers, bread and\n",
      "meat, wine, and hot coffee. Monsieur Defarge put this provender, and the\n",
      "lamp he carried, on the shoemaker’s bench (there was nothing else in the\n",
      "garret but a pallet bed), and he and Mr. Lorry roused the captive, and\n",
      "assisted him to his feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "No human intelligence could have read the mysteries of his mind, in\n",
      "the scared blank wonder of his face. Whether he knew what had happened,\n",
      "whether he recollected what they had said to him, whether he knew that\n",
      "he was free, were questions which no sagacity could have solved. They\n",
      "tried speaking to him; but, he was so confused, and so very slow to\n",
      "answer, that they took fright at his bewilderment, and agreed for\n",
      "the time to tamper with him no more. He had a wild, lost manner of\n",
      "occasionally clasping his head in his hands, that had not been seen\n",
      "in him before; yet, he had some pleasure in the mere sound of his\n",
      "daughter’s voice, and invariably turned to it when she spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the submissive way of one long accustomed to obey under coercion, he\n",
      "ate and drank what they gave him to eat and drink, and put on the cloak\n",
      "and other wrappings, that they gave him to wear. He readily responded to\n",
      "his daughter’s drawing her arm through his, and took--and kept--her hand\n",
      "in both his own.\n",
      "\n",
      "They began to descend; Monsieur Defarge going first with the lamp, Mr.\n",
      "Lorry closing the little procession. They had not traversed many steps\n",
      "of the long main staircase when he stopped, and stared at the roof and\n",
      "round at the walls.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You remember the place, my father? You remember coming up here?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What did you say?”\n",
      "\n",
      "But, before she could repeat the question, he murmured an answer as if\n",
      "she had repeated it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Remember? No, I don’t remember. It was so very long ago.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That he had no recollection whatever of his having been brought from his\n",
      "prison to that house, was apparent to them. They heard him mutter,\n",
      "“One Hundred and Five, North Tower;” and when he looked about him, it\n",
      "evidently was for the strong fortress-walls which had long encompassed\n",
      "him. On their reaching the courtyard he instinctively altered his\n",
      "tread, as being in expectation of a drawbridge; and when there was\n",
      "no drawbridge, and he saw the carriage waiting in the open street, he\n",
      "dropped his daughter’s hand and clasped his head again.\n",
      "\n",
      "No crowd was about the door; no people were discernible at any of the\n",
      "many windows; not even a chance passerby was in the street. An unnatural\n",
      "silence and desertion reigned there. Only one soul was to be seen, and\n",
      "that was Madame Defarge--who leaned against the door-post, knitting, and\n",
      "saw nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prisoner had got into a coach, and his daughter had followed\n",
      "him, when Mr. Lorry’s feet were arrested on the step by his asking,\n",
      "miserably, for his shoemaking tools and the unfinished shoes. Madame\n",
      "Defarge immediately called to her husband that she would get them, and\n",
      "went, knitting, out of the lamplight, through the courtyard. She quickly\n",
      "brought them down and handed them in;--and immediately afterwards leaned\n",
      "against the door-post, knitting, and saw nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Defarge got upon the box, and gave the word “To the Barrier!” The\n",
      "postilion cracked his whip, and they clattered away under the feeble\n",
      "over-swinging lamps.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the over-swinging lamps--swinging ever brighter in the better\n",
      "streets, and ever dimmer in the worse--and by lighted shops, gay crowds,\n",
      "illuminated coffee-houses, and theatre-doors, to one of the city\n",
      "gates. Soldiers with lanterns, at the guard-house there. “Your papers,\n",
      "travellers!” “See here then, Monsieur the Officer,” said Defarge,\n",
      "getting down, and taking him gravely apart, “these are the papers of\n",
      "monsieur inside, with the white head. They were consigned to me, with\n",
      "him, at the--” He dropped his voice, there was a flutter among the\n",
      "military lanterns, and one of them being handed into the coach by an arm\n",
      "in uniform, the eyes connected with the arm looked, not an every day\n",
      "or an every night look, at monsieur with the white head. “It is well.\n",
      "Forward!” from the uniform. “Adieu!” from Defarge. And so, under a short\n",

      "on a par with the Country; which did very often disinherit its sons for\n",
      "suggesting improvements in laws and customs that had long been highly\n",
      "objectionable, but were only the more respectable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus it had come to pass, that Tellson’s was the triumphant perfection\n",
      "of inconvenience. After bursting open a door of idiotic obstinacy with\n",
      "a weak rattle in its throat, you fell into Tellson’s down two steps,\n",
      "and came to your senses in a miserable little shop, with two little\n",
      "counters, where the oldest of men made your cheque shake as if the\n",
      "wind rustled it, while they examined the signature by the dingiest of\n",
      "windows, which were always under a shower-bath of mud from Fleet-street,\n",
      "and which were made the dingier by their own iron bars proper, and the\n",
      "heavy shadow of Temple Bar. If your business necessitated your seeing\n",
      "“the House,” you were put into a species of Condemned Hold at the back,\n",
      "where you meditated on a misspent life, until the House came with its\n",
      "hands in its pockets, and you could hardly blink at it in the dismal\n",
      "twilight. Your money came out of, or went into, wormy old wooden\n",
      "drawers, particles of which flew up your nose and down your throat when\n",
      "they were opened and shut. Your bank-notes had a musty odour, as if they\n",
      "were fast decomposing into rags again. Your plate was stowed away among\n",
      "the neighbouring cesspools, and evil communications corrupted its good\n",
      "polish in a day or two. Your deeds got into extemporised strong-rooms\n",
      "made of kitchens and sculleries, and fretted all the fat out of their\n",
      "parchments into the banking-house air. Your lighter boxes of family\n",
      "papers went up-stairs into a Barmecide room, that always had a great\n",
      "dining-table in it and never had a dinner, and where, even in the year\n",
      "one thousand seven hundred and eighty, the first letters written to you\n",
      "by your old love, or by your little children, were but newly released\n",
      "from the horror of being ogled through the windows, by the heads\n",
      "exposed on Temple Bar with an insensate brutality and ferocity worthy of\n",
      "Abyssinia or Ashantee.\n",
      "\n",
      "But indeed, at that time, putting to death was a recipe much in vogue\n",
      "with all trades and professions, and not least of all with Tellson’s.\n",
      "Death is Nature’s remedy for all things, and why not Legislation’s?\n",
      "Accordingly, the forger was put to Death; the utterer of a bad note\n",
      "was put to Death; the unlawful opener of a letter was put to Death; the\n",
      "purloiner of forty shillings and sixpence was put to Death; the holder\n",
      "of a horse at Tellson’s door, who made off with it, was put to\n",
      "Death; the coiner of a bad shilling was put to Death; the sounders of\n",
      "three-fourths of the notes in the whole gamut of Crime, were put to\n",
      "Death. Not that it did the least good in the way of prevention--it\n",
      "might almost have been worth remarking that the fact was exactly the\n",
      "reverse--but, it cleared off (as to this world) the trouble of each\n",
      "particular case, and left nothing else connected with it to be looked\n",
      "after. Thus, Tellson’s, in its day, like greater places of business,\n",
      "its contemporaries, had taken so many lives, that, if the heads laid\n",
      "low before it had been ranged on Temple Bar instead of being privately\n",
      "disposed of, they would probably have excluded what little light the\n",
      "ground floor had, in a rather significant manner.\n",

      "oldest of men carried on the business gravely. When they took a young\n",
      "man into Tellson’s London house, they hid him somewhere till he was\n",
      "old. They kept him in a dark place, like a cheese, until he had the full\n",
      "Tellson flavour and blue-mould upon him. Then only was he permitted to\n",
      "be seen, spectacularly poring over large books, and casting his breeches\n",
      "and gaiters into the general weight of the establishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Outside Tellson’s--never by any means in it, unless called in--was an\n",
      "odd-job-man, an occasional porter and messenger, who served as the live\n",
      "sign of the house. He was never absent during business hours, unless\n",
      "upon an errand, and then he was represented by his son: a grisly urchin\n",
      "of twelve, who was his express image. People understood that Tellson’s,\n",
      "in a stately way, tolerated the odd-job-man. The house had always\n",
      "tolerated some person in that capacity, and time and tide had drifted\n",
      "this person to the post. His surname was Cruncher, and on the youthful\n",
      "occasion of his renouncing by proxy the works of darkness, in the\n",

      "Whitefriars: the time, half-past seven of the clock on a windy March\n",
      "morning, Anno Domini seventeen hundred and eighty. (Mr. Cruncher himself\n",
      "always spoke of the year of our Lord as Anna Dominoes: apparently under\n",

      "but two in number, even if a closet with a single pane of glass in it\n",
      "might be counted as one. But they were very decently kept. Early as\n",
      "it was, on the windy March morning, the room in which he lay abed was\n",
      "already scrubbed throughout; and between the cups and saucers arranged\n",
      "for breakfast, and the lumbering deal table, a very clean white cloth\n",
      "was spread.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Cruncher reposed under a patchwork counterpane, like a Harlequin\n",
      "at home. At first, he slept heavily, but, by degrees, began to roll\n",
      "and surge in bed, until he rose above the surface, with his spiky hair\n",
      "looking as if it must tear the sheets to ribbons. At which juncture, he\n",

      "\n",
      "After hailing the morn with this second salutation, he threw a boot at\n",
      "the woman as a third. It was a very muddy boot, and may introduce the\n",
      "odd circumstance connected with Mr. Cruncher’s domestic economy, that,\n",
      "whereas he often came home after banking hours with clean boots, he\n",
      "often got up next morning to find the same boots covered with clay.\n",

      "\n",
      "Master Cruncher (who was in his shirt) took this very ill, and, turning\n",

      "you must go flopping yourself down, flop in favour of your husband and\n",

      "then, and if you see any signs of more flopping, give me a call. For, I\n",
      "tell you,” here he addressed his wife once more, “I won’t be gone agin,\n",
      "in this manner. I am as rickety as a hackney-coach, I’m as sleepy as\n",
      "laudanum, my lines is strained to that degree that I shouldn’t know, if\n",
      "it wasn’t for the pain in ’em, which was me and which somebody else, yet\n",

      "from the whirling grindstone of his indignation, Mr. Cruncher betook\n",
      "himself to his boot-cleaning and his general preparation for business.\n",
      "In the meantime, his son, whose head was garnished with tenderer spikes,\n",
      "and whose young eyes stood close by one another, as his father’s did,\n",
      "kept the required watch upon his mother. He greatly disturbed that poor\n",
      "woman at intervals, by darting out of his sleeping closet, where he made\n",

      "from any passing vehicle to keep the cold and wet from the odd-job-man’s\n",

      "standing by him, when not engaged in making forays through the Bar, to\n",
      "inflict bodily and mental injuries of an acute description on passing\n",
      "boys who were small enough for his amiable purpose. Father and son,\n",
      "extremely like each other, looking silently on at the morning traffic\n",
      "in Fleet-street, with their two heads as near to one another as the two\n",
      "eyes of each were, bore a considerable resemblance to a pair of monkeys.\n",
      "The resemblance was not lessened by the accidental circumstance, that\n",
      "the mature Jerry bit and spat out straw, while the twinkling eyes of the\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“You know the Old Bailey well, no doubt?” said one of the oldest of\n",
      "clerks to Jerry the messenger.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ye-es, sir,” returned Jerry, in something of a dogged manner. “I _do_\n",
      "know the Bailey.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Just so. And you know Mr. Lorry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know Mr. Lorry, sir, much better than I know the Bailey. Much\n",
      "better,” said Jerry, not unlike a reluctant witness at the establishment\n",
      "in question, “than I, as a honest tradesman, wish to know the Bailey.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very well. Find the door where the witnesses go in, and show the\n",
      "door-keeper this note for Mr. Lorry. He will then let you in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Into the court, sir?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Into the court.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Cruncher’s eyes seemed to get a little closer to one another, and to\n",
      "interchange the inquiry, “What do you think of this?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Am I to wait in the court, sir?” he asked, as the result of that\n",
      "conference.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am going to tell you. The door-keeper will pass the note to Mr.\n",
      "Lorry, and do you make any gesture that will attract Mr. Lorry’s\n",
      "attention, and show him where you stand. Then what you have to do, is,\n",
      "to remain there until he wants you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is that all, sir?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s all. He wishes to have a messenger at hand. This is to tell him\n",
      "you are there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As the ancient clerk deliberately folded and superscribed the note,\n",
      "Mr. Cruncher, after surveying him in silence until he came to the\n",
      "blotting-paper stage, remarked:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I suppose they’ll be trying Forgeries this morning?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Treason!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s quartering,” said Jerry. “Barbarous!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is the law,” remarked the ancient clerk, turning his surprised\n",
      "spectacles upon him. “It is the law.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s hard in the law to spile a man, I think. It’s hard enough to kill\n",
      "him, but it’s wery hard to spile him, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not at all,” retained the ancient clerk. “Speak well of the law. Take\n",
      "care of your chest and voice, my good friend, and leave the law to take\n",
      "care of itself. I give you that advice.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s the damp, sir, what settles on my chest and voice,” said Jerry. “I\n",
      "leave you to judge what a damp way of earning a living mine is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, well,” said the old clerk; “we all have our various ways of\n",
      "gaining a livelihood. Some of us have damp ways, and some of us have dry\n",
      "ways. Here is the letter. Go along.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Jerry took the letter, and, remarking to himself with less internal\n",
      "deference than he made an outward show of, “You are a lean old one,\n",
      "too,” made his bow, informed his son, in passing, of his destination,\n",
      "and went his way.\n",
      "\n",
      "They hanged at Tyburn, in those days, so the street outside Newgate had\n",
      "not obtained one infamous notoriety that has since attached to it.\n",
      "But, the gaol was a vile place, in which most kinds of debauchery and\n",
      "villainy were practised, and where dire diseases were bred, that came\n",
      "into court with the prisoners, and sometimes rushed straight from the\n",
      "dock at my Lord Chief Justice himself, and pulled him off the bench. It\n",
      "had more than once happened, that the Judge in the black cap pronounced\n",
      "his own doom as certainly as the prisoner’s, and even died before him.\n",
      "For the rest, the Old Bailey was famous as a kind of deadly inn-yard,\n",
      "from which pale travellers set out continually, in carts and coaches, on\n",
      "a violent passage into the other world: traversing some two miles and a\n",
      "half of public street and road, and shaming few good citizens, if any.\n",
      "So powerful is use, and so desirable to be good use in the beginning. It\n",
      "was famous, too, for the pillory, a wise old institution, that inflicted\n",
      "a punishment of which no one could foresee the extent; also, for\n",
      "the whipping-post, another dear old institution, very humanising and\n",
      "softening to behold in action; also, for extensive transactions in\n",
      "blood-money, another fragment of ancestral wisdom, systematically\n",
      "leading to the most frightful mercenary crimes that could be committed\n",
      "under Heaven. Altogether, the Old Bailey, at that date, was a choice\n",
      "illustration of the precept, that “Whatever is is right;” an aphorism\n",
      "that would be as final as it is lazy, did it not include the troublesome\n",
      "consequence, that nothing that ever was, was wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "Making his way through the tainted crowd, dispersed up and down this\n",
      "hideous scene of action, with the skill of a man accustomed to make his\n",
      "way quietly, the messenger found out the door he sought, and handed in\n",
      "his letter through a trap in it. For, people then paid to see the play\n",
      "at the Old Bailey, just as they paid to see the play in Bedlam--only the\n",
      "former entertainment was much the dearer. Therefore, all the Old Bailey\n",
      "doors were well guarded--except, indeed, the social doors by which the\n",
      "criminals got there, and those were always left wide open.\n",
      "\n",
      "After some delay and demur, the door grudgingly turned on its hinges a\n",
      "very little way, and allowed Mr. Jerry Cruncher to squeeze himself into\n",
      "court.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What’s on?” he asked, in a whisper, of the man he found himself next\n",
      "to.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing yet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What’s coming on?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The Treason case.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The quartering one, eh?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah!” returned the man, with a relish; “he’ll be drawn on a hurdle to\n",
      "be half hanged, and then he’ll be taken down and sliced before his own\n",
      "face, and then his inside will be taken out and burnt while he looks on,\n",
      "and then his head will be chopped off, and he’ll be cut into quarters.\n",
      "That’s the sentence.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If he’s found Guilty, you mean to say?” Jerry added, by way of proviso.\n",
      "\n",

      "Everybody present, except the one wigged gentleman who looked at the\n",

      "pillars and corners, to get a sight of him; spectators in back rows\n",
      "stood up, not to miss a hair of him; people on the floor of the court,\n",

      "whet he had taken as he came along, and discharging it to mingle with\n",
      "the waves of other beer, and gin, and tea, and coffee, and what not,\n",

      "dressed in black, or very dark grey, and his hair, which was long and\n",
      "dark, was gathered in a ribbon at the back of his neck; more to be out\n",
      "of his way than for ornament. As an emotion of the mind will express\n",
      "itself through any covering of the body, so the paleness which his\n",
      "situation engendered came through the brown upon his cheek, showing the\n",
      "soul to be stronger than the sun. He was otherwise quite self-possessed,\n",

      "details being spared--by just so much would he have lost in his\n",
      "fascination. The form that was to be doomed to be so shamefully mangled,\n",

      "claimed the forfeit of his life. That this correspondence with the\n",
      "public enemy was not a correspondence of to-day, or of yesterday, or\n",
      "even of last year, or of the year before. That, it was certain the\n",
      "prisoner had, for longer than that, been in the habit of passing and\n",
      "repassing between France and England, on secret business of which\n",
      "he could give no honest account. That, if it were in the nature of\n",
      "traitorous ways to thrive (which happily it never was), the real\n",
      "wickedness and guilt of his business might have remained undiscovered.\n",
      "That Providence, however, had put it into the heart of a person who\n",
      "was beyond fear and beyond reproach, to ferret out the nature of the\n",
      "prisoner’s schemes, and, struck with horror, to disclose them to his\n",
      "Majesty’s Chief Secretary of State and most honourable Privy Council.\n",
      "That, this patriot would be produced before them. That, his position and\n",
      "attitude were, on the whole, sublime. That, he had been the prisoner’s\n",
      "friend, but, at once in an auspicious and an evil hour detecting his\n",
      "infamy, had resolved to immolate the traitor he could no longer cherish\n",
      "in his bosom, on the sacred altar of his country. That, if statues\n",
      "were decreed in Britain, as in ancient Greece and Rome, to public\n",
      "benefactors, this shining citizen would assuredly have had one. That, as\n",
      "they were not so decreed, he probably would not have one. That, Virtue,\n",

      "whereat the jury’s countenances displayed a guilty consciousness that\n",

      "especially the bright virtue known as patriotism, or love of country.\n",
      "That, the lofty example of this immaculate and unimpeachable witness\n",
      "for the Crown, to refer to whom however unworthily was an honour, had\n",
      "communicated itself to the prisoner’s servant, and had engendered in him\n",
      "a holy determination to examine his master’s table-drawers and pockets,\n",
      "and secrete his papers. That, he (Mr. Attorney-General) was prepared to\n",
      "hear some disparagement attempted of this admirable servant; but that,\n",
      "in a general way, he preferred him to his (Mr. Attorney-General’s)\n",
      "brothers and sisters, and honoured him more than his (Mr.\n",
      "Attorney-General’s) father and mother. That, he called with confidence\n",

      "produced, would show the prisoner to have been furnished with lists of\n",
      "his Majesty’s forces, and of their disposition and preparation, both by\n",
      "sea and land, and would leave no doubt that he had habitually conveyed\n",

      "same; that, indeed, it was rather the better for the prosecution, as\n",
      "showing the prisoner to be artful in his precautions. That, the proof\n",
      "would go back five years, and would show the prisoner already engaged\n",
      "in these pernicious missions, within a few weeks before the date of the\n",
      "very first action fought between the British troops and the Americans.\n",
      "That, for these reasons, the jury, being a loyal jury (as he knew they\n",

      "times. Not five or six? Perhaps. Of what profession? Gentleman. Ever\n",

      "Decidedly not; once received a kick on the top of a staircase, and fell\n",
      "downstairs of his own accord. Kicked on that occasion for cheating at\n",
      "dice? Something to that effect was said by the intoxicated liar who\n",
      "committed the assault, but it was not true. Swear it was not true?\n",
      "Positively. Ever live by cheating at play? Never. Ever live by play? Not\n",
      "more than other gentlemen do. Ever borrow money of the prisoner? Yes.\n",
      "Ever pay him? No. Was not this intimacy with the prisoner, in reality a\n",
      "very slight one, forced upon the prisoner in coaches, inns, and packets?\n",
      "No. Sure he saw the prisoner with these lists? Certain. Knew no more\n",

      "traitor, an unblushing trafficker in blood, and one of the greatest\n",
      "scoundrels upon earth since accursed Judas--which he certainly did look\n",
      "rather like. How the virtuous servant, Cly, was his friend and partner,\n",

      "gallantries and politenesses likely to pass between any young gentleman\n",
      "and young lady so thrown together;--with the exception of that\n",
      "reference to George Washington, which was altogether too extravagant and\n",
      "impossible to be regarded in any other light than as a monstrous joke.\n",

      "character of evidence too often disfiguring such cases, and of which the\n",
      "State Trials of this country were full. But, there my Lord interposed\n",

      "Cly were even a hundred times better than he had thought them, and the\n",
      "prisoner a hundred times worse. Lastly, came my Lord himself, turning\n",
      "the suit of clothes, now inside out, now outside in, but on the whole\n",
      "decidedly trimming and shaping them into grave-clothes for the prisoner.\n",
      "\n",

      "whispered with those who sat near, and from time to time glanced\n",
      "anxiously at the jury; while all the spectators moved more or less, and\n",
      "grouped themselves anew; while even my Lord himself arose from his seat,\n",
      "and slowly paced up and down his platform, not unattended by a suspicion\n",
      "in the minds of the audience that his state was feverish; this one man\n",
      "sat leaning back, with his torn gown half off him, his untidy wig put\n",
      "on just as it had happened to light on his head after its removal, his\n",
      "hands in his pockets, and his eyes on the ceiling as they had been all\n",
      "day. Something especially reckless in his demeanour, not only gave him\n",
      "a disreputable look, but so diminished the strong resemblance he\n",
      "undoubtedly bore to the prisoner (which his momentary earnestness,\n",
      "when they were compared together, had strengthened), that many of the\n",
      "lookers-on, taking note of him now, said to one another they would\n",
      "hardly have thought the two were so alike. Mr. Cruncher made the\n",
      "observation to his next neighbour, and added, “I’d hold half a guinea\n",

      "her father’s breast, he was the first to see it, and to say audibly:\n",

      "him, to have the days of his imprisonment recalled. He had shown\n",
      "strong internal agitation when he was questioned, and that pondering or\n",
      "brooding look which made him old, had been upon him, like a heavy cloud,\n",
      "ever since. As he passed out, the jury, who had turned back and paused a\n",
      "moment, spoke, through their foreman.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were not agreed, and wished to retire. My Lord (perhaps with George\n",
      "Washington on his mind) showed some surprise that they were not agreed,\n",
      "but signified his pleasure that they should retire under watch and ward,\n",
      "and retired himself. The trial had lasted all day, and the lamps in\n",
      "the court were now being lighted. It began to be rumoured that the\n",
      "jury would be out a long while. The spectators dropped off to get\n",

      "misery, and to a Present beyond his misery: and the sound of her voice,\n",
      "the light of her face, the touch of her hand, had a strong beneficial\n",
      "influence with him almost always. Not absolutely always, for she could\n",

      "more than thirty, but looking twenty years older than he was, stout,\n",
      "loud, red, bluff, and free from any drawback of delicacy, had a pushing\n",
      "way of shouldering himself (morally and physically) into companies and\n",
      "conversations, that argued well for his shouldering his way up in life.\n",
      "\n",
      "He still had his wig and gown on, and he said, squaring himself at his\n",
      "late client to that degree that he squeezed the innocent Mr. Lorry clean\n",
      "out of the group: “I am glad to have brought you off with honour, Mr.\n",
      "Darnay. It was an infamous prosecution, grossly infamous; but not the\n",
      "less likely to succeed on that account.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have laid me under an obligation to you for life--in two senses,”\n",
      " said his late client, taking his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have done my best for you, Mr. Darnay; and my best is as good as\n",
      "another man’s, I believe.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It clearly being incumbent on some one to say, “Much better,” Mr. Lorry\n",
      "said it; perhaps not quite disinterestedly, but with the interested\n",
      "object of squeezing himself back again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You think so?” said Mr. Stryver. “Well! you have been present all day,\n",
      "and you ought to know. You are a man of business, too.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And as such,” quoth Mr. Lorry, whom the counsel learned in the law had\n",
      "now shouldered back into the group, just as he had previously shouldered\n",
      "him out of it--“as such I will appeal to Doctor Manette, to break up\n",
      "this conference and order us all to our homes. Miss Lucie looks ill, Mr.\n",
      "Darnay has had a terrible day, we are worn out.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“I speak for myself,” answered Mr. Lorry, “and for Mr. Darnay, and for\n",
      "Miss Lucie, and--Miss Lucie, do you not think I may speak for us all?”\n",
      " He asked her the question pointedly, and with a glance at her father.\n",
      "\n",
      "His face had become frozen, as it were, in a very curious look at\n",
      "Darnay: an intent look, deepening into a frown of dislike and distrust,\n",
      "not even unmixed with fear. With this strange expression on him his\n",
      "thoughts had wandered away.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My father,” said Lucie, softly laying her hand on his.\n",

      "released that night. The lights were nearly all extinguished in the\n",
      "passages, the iron gates were being closed with a jar and a rattle,\n",
      "and the dismal place was deserted until to-morrow morning’s interest of\n",

      "departed in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Stryver had left them in the passages, to shoulder his way back\n",
      "to the robing-room. Another person, who had not joined the group, or\n",
      "interchanged a word with any one of them, but who had been leaning\n",
      "against the wall where its shadow was darkest, had silently strolled\n",
      "out after the rest, and had looked on until the coach drove away. He now\n",
      "stepped up to where Mr. Lorry and Mr. Darnay stood upon the pavement.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So, Mr. Lorry! Men of business may speak to Mr. Darnay now?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Nobody had made any acknowledgment of Mr. Carton’s part in the day’s\n",
      "proceedings; nobody had known of it. He was unrobed, and was none the\n",
      "better for it in appearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you knew what a conflict goes on in the business mind, when the\n",
      "business mind is divided between good-natured impulse and business\n",
      "appearances, you would be amused, Mr. Darnay.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lorry reddened, and said, warmly, “You have mentioned that before,\n",

      "have to think of the House more than ourselves.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_I_ know, _I_ know,” rejoined Mr. Carton, carelessly. “Don’t be\n",

      "I dare say.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And indeed, sir,” pursued Mr. Lorry, not minding him, “I really don’t\n",
      "know what you have to do with the matter. If you’ll excuse me, as very\n",
      "much your elder, for saying so, I really don’t know that it is your\n",

      "\n",
      "“Business! Bless you, _I_ have no business,” said Mr. Carton.\n",

      "\n",
      "“Well, sir!” cried Mr. Lorry, thoroughly heated by his indifference,\n",
      "“business is a very good thing, and a very respectable thing. And, sir,\n",
      "if business imposes its restraints and its silences and impediments, Mr.\n",
      "Darnay as a young gentleman of generosity knows how to make allowance\n",
      "for that circumstance. Mr. Darnay, good night, God bless you, sir!\n",
      "I hope you have been this day preserved for a prosperous and happy\n",
      "life.--Chair there!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps a little angry with himself, as well as with the barrister, Mr.\n",
      "Lorry bustled into the chair, and was carried off to Tellson’s. Carton,\n",
      "who smelt of port wine, and did not appear to be quite sober, laughed\n",

      "some other. Let me show you the nearest tavern to dine well at.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Drawing his arm through his own, he took him down Ludgate-hill to\n",
      "Fleet-street, and so, up a covered way, into a tavern. Here, they were\n",
      "shown into a little room, where Charles Darnay was soon recruiting\n",
      "his strength with a good plain dinner and good wine: while Carton sat\n",
      "opposite to him at the same table, with his separate bottle of port\n",
      "before him, and his fully half-insolent manner upon him.\n",

      "“Do you feel, yet, that you belong to this terrestrial scheme again, Mr.\n",
      "Darnay?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am frightfully confused regarding time and place; but I am so far\n",
      "mended as to feel that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It must be an immense satisfaction!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He said it bitterly, and filled up his glass again: which was a large\n",
      "one.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As to me, the greatest desire I have, is to forget that I belong to it.\n",
      "It has no good in it for me--except wine like this--nor I for it. So we\n",

      "not much alike in any particular, you and I.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Confused by the emotion of the day, and feeling his being there with\n",

      "at a loss how to answer; finally, answered not at all.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“What health? What toast?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, it’s on the tip of your tongue. It ought to be, it must be, I’ll\n",

      "pieces; then, rang the bell, and ordered in another.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s a fair young lady to hand to a coach in the dark, Mr. Darnay!”\n",
      " he said, filling his new goblet.\n",
      "\n",
      "A slight frown and a laconic “Yes,” were the answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s a fair young lady to be pitied by and wept for by! How does it\n",
      "feel? Is it worth being tried for one’s life, to be the object of such\n",
      "sympathy and compassion, Mr. Darnay?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Again Darnay answered not a word.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She was mightily pleased to have your message, when I gave it her. Not\n",
      "that she showed she was pleased, but I suppose she was.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The allusion served as a timely reminder to Darnay that this\n",
      "disagreeable companion had, of his own free will, assisted him in the\n",
      "strait of the day. He turned the dialogue to that point, and thanked him\n",
      "for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I neither want any thanks, nor merit any,” was the careless rejoinder.\n",
      "“It was nothing to do, in the first place; and I don’t know why I did\n",

      "\n",
      "“But ask yourself the question now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have acted as if you do; but I don’t think you do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_I_ don’t think I do,” said Carton. “I begin to have a very good\n",

      "\n",
      "“Nevertheless,” pursued Darnay, rising to ring the bell, “there is\n",
      "nothing in that, I hope, to prevent my calling the reckoning, and our\n",
      "parting without ill-blood on either side.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Carton rejoining, “Nothing in life!” Darnay rang. “Do you call the whole\n",

      "ten.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The bill being paid, Charles Darnay rose and wished him good night.\n",
      "Without returning the wish, Carton rose too, with something of a threat\n",

      "\n",
      "“Much to be regretted. You might have used your talents better.”\n",

      "“Do you particularly like the man?” he muttered, at his own image; “why\n",

      "in the course of a night, without any detriment to his reputation as a\n",
      "perfect gentleman, would seem, in these days, a ridiculous exaggeration.\n",

      "\n",
      "It had once been noted at the Bar, that while Mr. Stryver was a glib\n",
      "man, and an unscrupulous, and a ready, and a bold, he had not that\n",
      "faculty of extracting the essence from a heap of statements, which is\n",

      "But, a remarkable improvement came upon him as to this. The more\n",

      "anywhere, but Carton was there, with his hands in his pockets, staring\n",
      "at the ceiling of the court; they went the same Circuit, and even there\n",
      "they prolonged their usual orgies late into the night, and Carton was\n",
      "rumoured to be seen at broad day, going home stealthily and unsteadily\n",

      "his hand. Both resorted to the drinking-table without stint, but each in\n",
      "a different way; the lion for the most part reclining with his hands in\n",
      "his waistband, looking at the fire, or occasionally flirting with some\n",
      "lighter document; the jackal, with knitted brows and intent face,\n",
      "so deep in his task, that his eyes did not even follow the hand he\n",
      "stretched out for his glass--which often groped about, for a minute or\n",
      "more, before it found the glass for his lips. Two or three times, the\n",
      "matter in hand became so knotty, that the jackal found it imperative on\n",
      "him to get up, and steep his towels anew. From these pilgrimages to the\n",
      "jug and basin, he returned with such eccentricities of damp headgear as\n",
      "no words can describe; which were made the more ludicrous by his anxious\n",
      "gravity.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length the jackal had got together a compact repast for the lion, and\n",
      "proceeded to offer it to him. The lion took it with care and caution,\n",
      "made his selections from it, and his remarks upon it, and the jackal\n",
      "assisted both. When the repast was fully discussed, the lion put his\n",
      "hands in his waistband again, and lay down to meditate. The jackal then\n",
      "invigorated himself with a bumper for his throttle, and a fresh application\n",
      "to his head, and applied himself to the collection of a second meal;\n",
      "this was administered to the lion in the same manner, and was not\n",
      "disposed of until the clocks struck three in the morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And now we have done, Sydney, fill a bumper of punch,” said Mr.\n",
      "Stryver.\n",
      "\n",
      "The jackal removed the towels from his head, which had been steaming\n",
      "again, shook himself, yawned, shivered, and complied.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You were very sound, Sydney, in the matter of those crown witnesses\n",
      "to-day. Every question told.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I always am sound; am I not?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t gainsay it. What has roughened your temper? Put some punch to\n",
      "it and smooth it again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "With a deprecatory grunt, the jackal again complied.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The old Sydney Carton of old Shrewsbury School,” said Stryver, nodding\n",
      "his head over him as he reviewed him in the present and the past, “the\n",
      "old seesaw Sydney. Up one minute and down the next; now in spirits and\n",
      "now in despondency!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah!” returned the other, sighing: “yes! The same Sydney, with the same\n",
      "luck. Even then, I did exercises for other boys, and seldom did my own.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And why not?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“God knows. It was my way, I suppose.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He sat, with his hands in his pockets and his legs stretched out before\n",
      "him, looking at the fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Carton,” said his friend, squaring himself at him with a bullying air,\n",
      "as if the fire-grate had been the furnace in which sustained endeavour\n",
      "was forged, and the one delicate thing to be done for the old Sydney\n",
      "Carton of old Shrewsbury School was to shoulder him into it, “your way\n",
      "is, and always was, a lame way. You summon no energy and purpose. Look\n",
      "at me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, botheration!” returned Sydney, with a lighter and more\n",
      "good-humoured laugh, “don’t _you_ be moral!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How have I done what I have done?” said Stryver; “how do I do what I\n",
      "do?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Partly through paying me to help you, I suppose. But it’s not worth\n",
      "your while to apostrophise me, or the air, about it; what you want to\n",
      "do, you do. You were always in the front rank, and I was always behind.”\n",

      "“I had to get into the front rank; I was not born there, was I?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was not present at the ceremony; but my opinion is you were,” said\n",
      "Carton. At this, he laughed again, and they both laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Before Shrewsbury, and at Shrewsbury, and ever since Shrewsbury,”\n",
      " pursued Carton, “you have fallen into your rank, and I have fallen into\n",
      "mine. Even when we were fellow-students in the Student-Quarter of Paris,\n",
      "picking up French, and French law, and other French crumbs that we\n",
      "didn’t get much good of, you were always somewhere, and I was always\n",
      "nowhere.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And whose fault was that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Upon my soul, I am not sure that it was not yours. You were always\n",
      "driving and riving and shouldering and passing, to that restless degree\n",
      "that I had no chance for my life but in rust and repose. It’s a gloomy\n",
      "thing, however, to talk about one’s own past, with the day breaking.\n",
      "Turn me in some other direction before I go.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well then! Pledge me to the pretty witness,” said Stryver, holding up\n",
      "his glass. “Are you turned in a pleasant direction?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Apparently not, for he became gloomy again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pretty witness,” he muttered, looking down into his glass. “I have had\n",

      "\n",
      "“Rot the admiration of the whole Court! Who made the Old Bailey a judge\n",
      "of beauty? She was a golden-haired doll!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you know, Sydney,” said Mr. Stryver, looking at him with sharp eyes,\n",
      "and slowly drawing a hand across his florid face: “do you know, I rather\n",
      "thought, at the time, that you sympathised with the golden-haired doll,\n",
      "and were quick to see what happened to the golden-haired doll?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Quick to see what happened! If a girl, doll or no doll, swoons within a\n",
      "yard or two of a man’s nose, he can see it without a perspective-glass.\n",

      "When his host followed him out on the staircase with a candle, to light\n",
      "him down the stairs, the day was coldly looking in through its grimy\n",
      "windows. When he got out of the house, the air was cold and sad, the\n",
      "dull sky overcast, the river dark and dim, the whole scene like a\n",
      "lifeless desert. And wreaths of dust were spinning round and round\n",
      "before the morning blast, as if the desert-sand had risen far away, and\n",
      "the first spray of it in its advance had begun to overwhelm the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "Waste forces within him, and a desert all around, this man stood still\n",
      "on his way across a silent terrace, and saw for a moment, lying in the\n",
      "wilderness before him, a mirage of honourable ambition, self-denial, and\n",
      "perseverance. In the fair city of this vision, there were airy galleries\n",
      "from which the loves and graces looked upon him, gardens in which the\n",
      "fruits of life hung ripening, waters of Hope that sparkled in his sight.\n",
      "A moment, and it was gone. Climbing to a high chamber in a well of\n",
      "houses, he threw himself down in his clothes on a neglected bed, and its\n",
      "pillow was wet with wasted tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sadly, sadly, the sun rose; it rose upon no sadder sight than the man of\n",
      "good abilities and good emotions, incapable of their directed exercise,\n",
      "incapable of his own help and his own happiness, sensible of the blight\n",

      "The quiet lodgings of Doctor Manette were in a quiet street-corner not\n",
      "far from Soho-square. On the afternoon of a certain fine Sunday when the\n",
      "waves of four months had rolled over the trial for treason, and carried\n",
      "it, as to the public interest and memory, far out to sea, Mr. Jarvis\n",
      "Lorry walked along the sunny streets from Clerkenwell where he lived,\n",
      "on his way to dine with the Doctor. After several relapses into\n",
      "business-absorption, Mr. Lorry had become the Doctor’s friend, and the\n",
      "quiet street-corner was the sunny part of his life.\n",
      "\n",
      "On this certain fine Sunday, Mr. Lorry walked towards Soho, early in\n",
      "the afternoon, for three reasons of habit. Firstly, because, on fine\n",
      "Sundays, he often walked out, before dinner, with the Doctor and Lucie;\n",
      "secondly, because, on unfavourable Sundays, he was accustomed to be with\n",
      "them as the family friend, talking, reading, looking out of window, and\n",
      "generally getting through the day; thirdly, because he happened to have\n",
      "his own little shrewd doubts to solve, and knew how the ways of the\n",
      "Doctor’s household pointed to that time as a likely time for solving\n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "A quainter corner than the corner where the Doctor lived, was not to be\n",
      "found in London. There was no way through it, and the front windows of\n",
      "the Doctor’s lodgings commanded a pleasant little vista of street that\n",
      "had a congenial air of retirement on it. There were few buildings then,\n",
      "north of the Oxford-road, and forest-trees flourished, and wild flowers\n",
      "grew, and the hawthorn blossomed, in the now vanished fields. As a\n",
      "consequence, country airs circulated in Soho with vigorous freedom,\n",
      "instead of languishing into the parish like stray paupers without a\n",
      "settlement; and there was many a good south wall, not far off, on which\n",
      "the peaches ripened in their season.\n",
      "\n",
      "The summer light struck into the corner brilliantly in the earlier part\n",
      "of the day; but, when the streets grew hot, the corner was in shadow,\n",
      "though not in shadow so remote but that you could see beyond it into a\n",
      "glare of brightness. It was a cool spot, staid but cheerful, a wonderful\n",
      "place for echoes, and a very harbour from the raging streets.\n",
      "\n",
      "There ought to have been a tranquil bark in such an anchorage, and\n",
      "there was. The Doctor occupied two floors of a large stiff house, where\n",
      "several callings purported to be pursued by day, but whereof little was\n",
      "audible any day, and which was shunned by all of them at night. In\n",
      "a building at the back, attainable by a courtyard where a plane-tree\n",
      "rustled its green leaves, church-organs claimed to be made, and silver\n",
      "to be chased, and likewise gold to be beaten by some mysterious giant\n",
      "who had a golden arm starting out of the wall of the front hall--as if\n",
      "he had beaten himself precious, and menaced a similar conversion of all\n",
      "visitors. Very little of these trades, or of a lonely lodger rumoured\n",
      "to live up-stairs, or of a dim coach-trimming maker asserted to have\n",
      "a counting-house below, was ever heard or seen. Occasionally, a stray\n",
      "workman putting his coat on, traversed the hall, or a stranger peered\n",
      "about there, or a distant clink was heard across the courtyard, or a\n",
      "thump from the golden giant. These, however, were only the exceptions\n",
      "required to prove the rule that the sparrows in the plane-tree behind\n",
      "the house, and the echoes in the corner before it, had their own way\n",
      "from Sunday morning unto Saturday night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Doctor Manette received such patients here as his old reputation, and\n",
      "its revival in the floating whispers of his story, brought him.\n",
      "His scientific knowledge, and his vigilance and skill in conducting\n",
      "ingenious experiments, brought him otherwise into moderate request, and\n",
      "he earned as much as he wanted.\n",
      "\n",
      "These things were within Mr. Jarvis Lorry’s knowledge, thoughts, and\n",
      "notice, when he rang the door-bell of the tranquil house in the corner,\n",
      "on the fine Sunday afternoon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Doctor Manette at home?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Expected home.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Lucie at home?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Expected home.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Pross at home?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Possibly at home, but of a certainty impossible for handmaid to\n",
      "anticipate intentions of Miss Pross, as to admission or denial of the\n",
      "fact.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As I am at home myself,” said Mr. Lorry, “I’ll go upstairs.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the Doctor’s daughter had known nothing of the country of her\n",
      "birth, she appeared to have innately derived from it that ability to\n",
      "make much of little means, which is one of its most useful and most\n",
      "agreeable characteristics. Simple as the furniture was, it was set off\n",
      "by so many little adornments, of no value but for their taste and fancy,\n",
      "that its effect was delightful. The disposition of everything in the\n",
      "rooms, from the largest object to the least; the arrangement of colours,\n",
      "the elegant variety and contrast obtained by thrift in trifles, by\n",
      "delicate hands, clear eyes, and good sense; were at once so pleasant in\n",
      "themselves, and so expressive of their originator, that, as Mr. Lorry\n",
      "stood looking about him, the very chairs and tables seemed to ask him,\n",
      "with something of that peculiar expression which he knew so well by this\n",
      "time, whether he approved?\n",
      "\n",
      "There were three rooms on a floor, and, the doors by which they\n",
      "communicated being put open that the air might pass freely through them\n",
      "all, Mr. Lorry, smilingly observant of that fanciful resemblance which\n",
      "he detected all around him, walked from one to another. The first was\n",
      "the best room, and in it were Lucie’s birds, and flowers, and books,\n",
      "and desk, and work-table, and box of water-colours; the second was\n",
      "the Doctor’s consulting-room, used also as the dining-room; the third,\n",
      "changingly speckled by the rustle of the plane-tree in the yard, was the\n",
      "Doctor’s bedroom, and there, in a corner, stood the disused shoemaker’s\n",
      "bench and tray of tools, much as it had stood on the fifth floor of the\n",
      "dismal house by the wine-shop, in the suburb of Saint Antoine in Paris.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wonder,” said Mr. Lorry, pausing in his looking about, “that he keeps\n",
      "that reminder of his sufferings about him!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And why wonder at that?” was the abrupt inquiry that made him start.\n",
      "\n",
      "It proceeded from Miss Pross, the wild red woman, strong of hand, whose\n",
      "acquaintance he had first made at the Royal George Hotel at Dover, and\n",
      "had since improved.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should have thought--” Mr. Lorry began.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pooh! You’d have thought!” said Miss Pross; and Mr. Lorry left off.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How do you do?” inquired that lady then--sharply, and yet as if to\n",
      "express that she bore him no malice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am pretty well, I thank you,” answered Mr. Lorry, with meekness; “how\n",
      "are you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing to boast of,” said Miss Pross.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! indeed!” said Miss Pross. “I am very much put out about my\n",
      "Ladybird.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“For gracious sake say something else besides ‘indeed,’ or you’ll\n",
      "fidget me to death,” said Miss Pross: whose character (dissociated from\n",
      "stature) was shortness.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Really, then?” said Mr. Lorry, as an amendment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Really, is bad enough,” returned Miss Pross, “but better. Yes, I am\n",
      "very much put out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“May I ask the cause?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t want dozens of people who are not at all worthy of Ladybird, to\n",
      "come here looking after her,” said Miss Pross.\n",
      "\n",
      "“_Do_ dozens come for that purpose?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hundreds,” said Miss Pross.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was characteristic of this lady (as of some other people before her\n",
      "time and since) that whenever her original proposition was questioned,\n",
      "she exaggerated it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dear me!” said Mr. Lorry, as the safest remark he could think of.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have lived with the darling--or the darling has lived with me, and\n",
      "paid me for it; which she certainly should never have done, you may take\n",
      "your affidavit, if I could have afforded to keep either myself or her\n",
      "for nothing--since she was ten years old. And it’s really very hard,”\n",
      " said Miss Pross.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not seeing with precision what was very hard, Mr. Lorry shook his head;\n",
      "using that important part of himself as a sort of fairy cloak that would\n",
      "fit anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "“All sorts of people who are not in the least degree worthy of the pet,\n",
      "are always turning up,” said Miss Pross. “When you began it--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_I_ began it, Miss Pross?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Didn’t you? Who brought her father to life?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! If _that_ was beginning it--” said Mr. Lorry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It wasn’t ending it, I suppose? I say, when you began it, it was hard\n",
      "enough; not that I have any fault to find with Doctor Manette, except\n",
      "that he is not worthy of such a daughter, which is no imputation on\n",
      "him, for it was not to be expected that anybody should be, under any\n",
      "circumstances. But it really is doubly and trebly hard to have crowds\n",
      "and multitudes of people turning up after him (I could have forgiven\n",
      "him), to take Ladybird’s affections away from me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lorry knew Miss Pross to be very jealous, but he also knew her by\n",
      "this time to be, beneath the service of her eccentricity, one of those\n",
      "unselfish creatures--found only among women--who will, for pure love and\n",
      "admiration, bind themselves willing slaves, to youth when they have lost\n",
      "it, to beauty that they never had, to accomplishments that they were\n",
      "never fortunate enough to gain, to bright hopes that never shone upon\n",
      "their own sombre lives. He knew enough of the world to know that there\n",
      "is nothing in it better than the faithful service of the heart; so\n",
      "rendered and so free from any mercenary taint, he had such an exalted\n",
      "respect for it, that in the retributive arrangements made by his own\n",
      "mind--we all make such arrangements, more or less--he stationed Miss\n",
      "Pross much nearer to the lower Angels than many ladies immeasurably\n",
      "better got up both by Nature and Art, who had balances at Tellson’s.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There never was, nor will be, but one man worthy of Ladybird,” said\n",
      "Miss Pross; “and that was my brother Solomon, if he hadn’t made a\n",
      "mistake in life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Here again: Mr. Lorry’s inquiries into Miss Pross’s personal history had\n",
      "established the fact that her brother Solomon was a heartless scoundrel\n",
      "who had stripped her of everything she possessed, as a stake to\n",
      "speculate with, and had abandoned her in her poverty for evermore, with\n",
      "no touch of compunction. Miss Pross’s fidelity of belief in Solomon\n",
      "(deducting a mere trifle for this slight mistake) was quite a serious\n",
      "matter with Mr. Lorry, and had its weight in his good opinion of her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As we happen to be alone for the moment, and are both people of\n",

      "\n",
      "“Never.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And yet keeps that bench and those tools beside him?”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Do you believe that he thinks of it much?”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Now and then,” said Miss Pross.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you suppose,” Mr. Lorry went on, with a laughing twinkle in his\n",
      "bright eye, as it looked kindly at her, “that Doctor Manette has any\n",
      "theory of his own, preserved through all those years, relative to\n",
      "the cause of his being so oppressed; perhaps, even to the name of his\n",
      "oppressor?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t suppose anything about it but what Ladybird tells me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And that is--?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That she thinks he has.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now don’t be angry at my asking all these questions; because I am a\n",
      "mere dull man of business, and you are a woman of business.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dull?” Miss Pross inquired, with placidity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rather wishing his modest adjective away, Mr. Lorry replied, “No, no,\n",
      "no. Surely not. To return to business:--Is it not remarkable that Doctor\n",
      "Manette, unquestionably innocent of any crime as we are all well assured\n",
      "he is, should never touch upon that question? I will not say with me,\n",
      "though he had business relations with me many years ago, and we are now\n",
      "intimate; I will say with the fair daughter to whom he is so devotedly\n",
      "attached, and who is so devotedly attached to him? Believe me, Miss\n",
      "Pross, I don’t approach the topic with you, out of curiosity, but out of\n",
      "zealous interest.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well! To the best of my understanding, and bad’s the best, you’ll tell\n",
      "me,” said Miss Pross, softened by the tone of the apology, “he is afraid\n",
      "of the whole subject.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Afraid?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s plain enough, I should think, why he may be. It’s a dreadful\n",
      "remembrance. Besides that, his loss of himself grew out of it. Not\n",
      "knowing how he lost himself, or how he recovered himself, he may never\n",
      "feel certain of not losing himself again. That alone wouldn’t make the\n",
      "subject pleasant, I should think.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a profounder remark than Mr. Lorry had looked for. “True,” said\n",
      "he, “and fearful to reflect upon. Yet, a doubt lurks in my mind, Miss\n",
      "Pross, whether it is good for Doctor Manette to have that suppression\n",
      "always shut up within him. Indeed, it is this doubt and the uneasiness\n",
      "it sometimes causes me that has led me to our present confidence.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Can’t be helped,” said Miss Pross, shaking her head. “Touch that\n",
      "string, and he instantly changes for the worse. Better leave it alone.\n",
      "In short, must leave it alone, like or no like. Sometimes, he gets up in\n",
      "the dead of the night, and will be heard, by us overhead there, walking\n",
      "up and down, walking up and down, in his room. Ladybird has learnt to\n",
      "know then that his mind is walking up and down, walking up and down, in\n",
      "his old prison. She hurries to him, and they go on together, walking up\n",
      "and down, walking up and down, until he is composed. But he never says\n",
      "a word of the true reason of his restlessness, to her, and she finds it\n",
      "best not to hint at it to him. In silence they go walking up and down\n",
      "together, walking up and down together, till her love and company have\n",
      "brought him to himself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Notwithstanding Miss Pross’s denial of her own imagination, there was a\n",
      "perception of the pain of being monotonously haunted by one sad idea,\n",
      "in her repetition of the phrase, walking up and down, which testified to\n",
      "her possessing such a thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The corner has been mentioned as a wonderful corner for echoes; it\n",
      "had begun to echo so resoundingly to the tread of coming feet, that it\n",
      "seemed as though the very mention of that weary pacing to and fro had\n",
      "set it going.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here they are!” said Miss Pross, rising to break up the conference;\n",
      "“and now we shall have hundreds of people pretty soon!”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was such a curious corner in its acoustical properties, such a\n",
      "peculiar Ear of a place, that as Mr. Lorry stood at the open window,\n",
      "looking for the father and daughter whose steps he heard, he fancied\n",
      "they would never approach. Not only would the echoes die away, as though\n",
      "the steps had gone; but, echoes of other steps that never came would be\n",
      "heard in their stead, and would die away for good when they seemed close\n",
      "at hand. However, father and daughter did at last appear, and Miss Pross\n",
      "was ready at the street door to receive them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Pross was a pleasant sight, albeit wild, and red, and grim, taking\n",
      "off her darling’s bonnet when she came up-stairs, and touching it up\n",
      "with the ends of her handkerchief, and blowing the dust off it, and\n",
      "folding her mantle ready for laying by, and smoothing her rich hair with\n",
      "as much pride as she could possibly have taken in her own hair if she\n",
      "had been the vainest and handsomest of women. Her darling was a pleasant\n",
      "sight too, embracing her and thanking her, and protesting against\n",
      "her taking so much trouble for her--which last she only dared to do\n",
      "playfully, or Miss Pross, sorely hurt, would have retired to her own\n",
      "chamber and cried. The Doctor was a pleasant sight too, looking on at\n",
      "them, and telling Miss Pross how she spoilt Lucie, in accents and with\n",
      "eyes that had as much spoiling in them as Miss Pross had, and would\n",
      "have had more if it were possible. Mr. Lorry was a pleasant sight too,\n",
      "beaming at all this in his little wig, and thanking his bachelor\n",
      "stars for having lighted him in his declining years to a Home. But, no\n",
      "Hundreds of people came to see the sights, and Mr. Lorry looked in vain\n",
      "for the fulfilment of Miss Pross’s prediction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dinner-time, and still no Hundreds of people. In the arrangements of\n",
      "the little household, Miss Pross took charge of the lower regions, and\n",
      "always acquitted herself marvellously. Her dinners, of a very modest\n",
      "quality, were so well cooked and so well served, and so neat in their\n",
      "contrivances, half English and half French, that nothing could be\n",
      "better. Miss Pross’s friendship being of the thoroughly practical\n",
      "kind, she had ravaged Soho and the adjacent provinces, in search of\n",
      "impoverished French, who, tempted by shillings and half-crowns, would\n",
      "impart culinary mysteries to her. From these decayed sons and daughters\n",
      "of Gaul, she had acquired such wonderful arts, that the woman and girl\n",
      "who formed the staff of domestics regarded her as quite a Sorceress,\n",
      "or Cinderella’s Godmother: who would send out for a fowl, a rabbit,\n",
      "a vegetable or two from the garden, and change them into anything she\n",
      "pleased.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Sundays, Miss Pross dined at the Doctor’s table, but on other days\n",
      "persisted in taking her meals at unknown periods, either in the lower\n",
      "regions, or in her own room on the second floor--a blue chamber, to\n",
      "which no one but her Ladybird ever gained admittance. On this occasion,\n",
      "Miss Pross, responding to Ladybird’s pleasant face and pleasant efforts\n",
      "to please her, unbent exceedingly; so the dinner was very pleasant, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was an oppressive day, and, after dinner, Lucie proposed that the\n",
      "wine should be carried out under the plane-tree, and they should sit\n",
      "there in the air. As everything turned upon her, and revolved about her,\n",
      "they went out under the plane-tree, and she carried the wine down for\n",
      "the special benefit of Mr. Lorry. She had installed herself, some\n",
      "time before, as Mr. Lorry’s cup-bearer; and while they sat under the\n",
      "plane-tree, talking, she kept his glass replenished. Mysterious backs\n",
      "and ends of houses peeped at them as they talked, and the plane-tree\n",
      "whispered to them in its own way above their heads.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, the Hundreds of people did not present themselves. Mr. Darnay\n",
      "presented himself while they were sitting under the plane-tree, but he\n",
      "was only One.\n",
      "\n",
      "Doctor Manette received him kindly, and so did Lucie. But, Miss Pross\n",
      "suddenly became afflicted with a twitching in the head and body, and\n",
      "retired into the house. She was not unfrequently the victim of this\n",
      "disorder, and she called it, in familiar conversation, “a fit of the\n",
      "jerks.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Doctor was in his best condition, and looked specially young. The\n",
      "resemblance between him and Lucie was very strong at such times, and as\n",
      "they sat side by side, she leaning on his shoulder, and he resting\n",
      "his arm on the back of her chair, it was very agreeable to trace the\n",
      "likeness.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had been talking all day, on many subjects, and with unusual\n",
      "vivacity. “Pray, Doctor Manette,” said Mr. Darnay, as they sat under the\n",
      "plane-tree--and he said it in the natural pursuit of the topic in hand,\n",
      "which happened to be the old buildings of London--“have you seen much of\n",
      "the Tower?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lucie and I have been there; but only casually. We have seen enough of\n",
      "it, to know that it teems with interest; little more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_I_ have been there, as you remember,” said Darnay, with a smile,\n",
      "though reddening a little angrily, “in another character, and not in a\n",
      "character that gives facilities for seeing much of it. They told me a\n",
      "curious thing when I was there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What was that?” Lucie asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In making some alterations, the workmen came upon an old dungeon, which\n",
      "had been, for many years, built up and forgotten. Every stone of\n",
      "its inner wall was covered by inscriptions which had been carved by\n",
      "prisoners--dates, names, complaints, and prayers. Upon a corner stone\n",
      "in an angle of the wall, one prisoner, who seemed to have gone to\n",
      "execution, had cut as his last work, three letters. They were done with\n",
      "some very poor instrument, and hurriedly, with an unsteady hand.\n",
      "At first, they were read as D. I. C.; but, on being more carefully\n",
      "examined, the last letter was found to be G. There was no record or\n",
      "legend of any prisoner with those initials, and many fruitless guesses\n",
      "were made what the name could have been. At length, it was suggested\n",
      "that the letters were not initials, but the complete word, DIG. The\n",
      "floor was examined very carefully under the inscription, and, in the\n",
      "earth beneath a stone, or tile, or some fragment of paving, were found\n",
      "the ashes of a paper, mingled with the ashes of a small leathern case\n",
      "or bag. What the unknown prisoner had written will never be read, but he\n",
      "had written something, and hidden it away to keep it from the gaoler.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My father,” exclaimed Lucie, “you are ill!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He had suddenly started up, with his hand to his head. His manner and\n",
      "his look quite terrified them all.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, my dear, not ill. There are large drops of rain falling, and they\n",
      "made me start. We had better go in.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He recovered himself almost instantly. Rain was really falling in large\n",
      "drops, and he showed the back of his hand with rain-drops on it. But, he\n",
      "said not a single word in reference to the discovery that had been told\n",
      "of, and, as they went into the house, the business eye of Mr. Lorry\n",
      "either detected, or fancied it detected, on his face, as it turned\n",
      "towards Charles Darnay, the same singular look that had been upon it\n",
      "when it turned towards him in the passages of the Court House.\n",
      "\n",
      "He recovered himself so quickly, however, that Mr. Lorry had doubts of\n",
      "his business eye. The arm of the golden giant in the hall was not more\n",
      "steady than he was, when he stopped under it to remark to them that he\n",
      "was not yet proof against slight surprises (if he ever would be), and\n",
      "that the rain had startled him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tea-time, and Miss Pross making tea, with another fit of the jerks upon\n",
      "her, and yet no Hundreds of people. Mr. Carton had lounged in, but he\n",
      "made only Two.\n",
      "\n",
      "The night was so very sultry, that although they sat with doors and\n",
      "windows open, they were overpowered by heat. When the tea-table was\n",
      "done with, they all moved to one of the windows, and looked out into the\n",
      "heavy twilight. Lucie sat by her father; Darnay sat beside her; Carton\n",
      "leaned against a window. The curtains were long and white, and some of\n",
      "the thunder-gusts that whirled into the corner, caught them up to the\n",
      "ceiling, and waved them like spectral wings.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The rain-drops are still falling, large, heavy, and few,” said Doctor\n",
      "Manette. “It comes slowly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It comes surely,” said Carton.\n",
      "\n",
      "They spoke low, as people watching and waiting mostly do; as people in a\n",
      "dark room, watching and waiting for Lightning, always do.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a great hurry in the streets of people speeding away to\n",
      "get shelter before the storm broke; the wonderful corner for echoes\n",
      "resounded with the echoes of footsteps coming and going, yet not a\n",
      "footstep was there.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A multitude of people, and yet a solitude!” said Darnay, when they had\n",
      "listened for a while.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is it not impressive, Mr. Darnay?” asked Lucie. “Sometimes, I have\n",
      "sat here of an evening, until I have fancied--but even the shade of\n",
      "a foolish fancy makes me shudder to-night, when all is so black and\n",
      "solemn--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let us shudder too. We may know what it is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It will seem nothing to you. Such whims are only impressive as we\n",
      "originate them, I think; they are not to be communicated. I have\n",
      "sometimes sat alone here of an evening, listening, until I have made\n",
      "the echoes out to be the echoes of all the footsteps that are coming\n",
      "by-and-bye into our lives.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is a great crowd coming one day into our lives, if that be so,”\n",
      " Sydney Carton struck in, in his moody way.\n",
      "\n",
      "The footsteps were incessant, and the hurry of them became more and more\n",
      "rapid. The corner echoed and re-echoed with the tread of feet; some,\n",
      "as it seemed, under the windows; some, as it seemed, in the room; some\n",
      "coming, some going, some breaking off, some stopping altogether; all in\n",
      "the distant streets, and not one within sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are all these footsteps destined to come to all of us, Miss Manette, or\n",
      "are we to divide them among us?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t know, Mr. Darnay; I told you it was a foolish fancy, but you\n",
      "asked for it. When I have yielded myself to it, I have been alone, and\n",
      "then I have imagined them the footsteps of the people who are to come\n",
      "into my life, and my father’s.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I take them into mine!” said Carton. “_I_ ask no questions and make no\n",
      "stipulations. There is a great crowd bearing down upon us, Miss Manette,\n",
      "and I see them--by the Lightning.” He added the last words, after there\n",
      "had been a vivid flash which had shown him lounging in the window.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And I hear them!” he added again, after a peal of thunder. “Here they\n",
      "come, fast, fierce, and furious!”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the rush and roar of rain that he typified, and it stopped him,\n",
      "for no voice could be heard in it. A memorable storm of thunder and\n",
      "lightning broke with that sweep of water, and there was not a moment’s\n",
      "interval in crash, and fire, and rain, until after the moon rose at\n",
      "midnight.\n",
      "\n",
      "The great bell of Saint Paul’s was striking one in the cleared air, when\n",
      "Mr. Lorry, escorted by Jerry, high-booted and bearing a lantern, set\n",
      "forth on his return-passage to Clerkenwell. There were solitary patches\n",
      "of road on the way between Soho and Clerkenwell, and Mr. Lorry, mindful\n",
      "of foot-pads, always retained Jerry for this service: though it was\n",
      "usually performed a good two hours earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What a night it has been! Almost a night, Jerry,” said Mr. Lorry, “to\n",
      "bring the dead out of their graves.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I never see the night myself, master--nor yet I don’t expect to--what\n",

      "CHAPTER VII.\n",
      "Monseigneur in Town\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Monseigneur, one of the great lords in power at the Court, held his\n",
      "fortnightly reception in his grand hotel in Paris. Monseigneur was in\n",
      "his inner room, his sanctuary of sanctuaries, the Holiest of Holiests to\n",
      "the crowd of worshippers in the suite of rooms without. Monseigneur\n",
      "was about to take his chocolate. Monseigneur could swallow a great many\n",
      "things with ease, and was by some few sullen minds supposed to be rather\n",
      "rapidly swallowing France; but, his morning’s chocolate could not so\n",
      "much as get into the throat of Monseigneur, without the aid of four\n",
      "strong men besides the Cook.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes. It took four men, all four ablaze with gorgeous decoration, and the\n",
      "Chief of them unable to exist with fewer than two gold watches in his\n",
      "pocket, emulative of the noble and chaste fashion set by Monseigneur, to\n",
      "conduct the happy chocolate to Monseigneur’s lips. One lacquey carried\n",
      "the chocolate-pot into the sacred presence; a second, milled and frothed\n",
      "the chocolate with the little instrument he bore for that function;\n",
      "a third, presented the favoured napkin; a fourth (he of the two gold\n",
      "watches), poured the chocolate out. It was impossible for Monseigneur to\n",
      "dispense with one of these attendants on the chocolate and hold his high\n",
      "place under the admiring Heavens. Deep would have been the blot upon\n",
      "his escutcheon if his chocolate had been ignobly waited on by only three\n",
      "men; he must have died of two.\n",
      "\n",
      "Monseigneur had been out at a little supper last night, where the Comedy\n",
      "and the Grand Opera were charmingly represented. Monseigneur was out at\n",
      "a little supper most nights, with fascinating company. So polite and so\n",
      "impressible was Monseigneur, that the Comedy and the Grand Opera had far\n",
      "more influence with him in the tiresome articles of state affairs and\n",
      "state secrets, than the needs of all France. A happy circumstance\n",
      "for France, as the like always is for all countries similarly\n",
      "favoured!--always was for England (by way of example), in the regretted\n",
      "days of the merry Stuart who sold it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Monseigneur had one truly noble idea of general public business, which\n",
      "was, to let everything go on in its own way; of particular public\n",
      "business, Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea that it must all go\n",
      "his way--tend to his own power and pocket. Of his pleasures, general and\n",
      "particular, Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea, that the world\n",
      "was made for them. The text of his order (altered from the original\n",
      "by only a pronoun, which is not much) ran: “The earth and the fulness\n",
      "thereof are mine, saith Monseigneur.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, Monseigneur had slowly found that vulgar embarrassments crept into\n",
      "his affairs, both private and public; and he had, as to both classes of\n",
      "affairs, allied himself perforce with a Farmer-General. As to finances\n",
      "public, because Monseigneur could not make anything at all of them, and\n",
      "must consequently let them out to somebody who could; as to finances\n",
      "private, because Farmer-Generals were rich, and Monseigneur, after\n",
      "generations of great luxury and expense, was growing poor. Hence\n",
      "Monseigneur had taken his sister from a convent, while there was yet\n",
      "time to ward off the impending veil, the cheapest garment she could\n",
      "wear, and had bestowed her as a prize upon a very rich Farmer-General,\n",
      "poor in family. Which Farmer-General, carrying an appropriate cane with\n",
      "a golden apple on the top of it, was now among the company in the outer\n",
      "rooms, much prostrated before by mankind--always excepting superior\n",
      "mankind of the blood of Monseigneur, who, his own wife included, looked\n",
      "down upon him with the loftiest contempt.\n",
      "\n",
      "A sumptuous man was the Farmer-General. Thirty horses stood in his\n",
      "stables, twenty-four male domestics sat in his halls, six body-women\n",

      "have been an exceedingly uncomfortable business--if that could have\n",

      "yet equally unconnected with anything that was real, or with lives\n",

      "no less abundant. Doctors who made great fortunes out of dainty remedies\n",
      "for imaginary disorders that never existed, smiled upon their courtly\n",
      "patients in the ante-chambers of Monseigneur. Projectors who had\n",
      "discovered every kind of remedy for the little evils with which the\n",

      "root out a single sin, poured their distracting babble into any ears\n",
      "they could lay hold of, at the reception of Monseigneur. Unbelieving\n",

      "exhaustion, at the hotel of Monseigneur. Such homes had these various\n",
      "notabilities left behind them in the fine world of Paris, that the spies\n",
      "among the assembled devotees of Monseigneur--forming a goodly half\n",
      "of the polite company--would have found it hard to discover among\n",

      "appearance, owned to being a Mother. Indeed, except for the mere act of\n",
      "bringing a troublesome creature into this world--which does not go far\n",
      "towards the realisation of the name of mother--there was no such thing\n",
      "known to the fashion. Peasant women kept the unfashionable babies close,\n",
      "and brought them up, and charming grandmammas of sixty dressed and\n",
      "supped as at twenty.\n",
      "\n",
      "The leprosy of unreality disfigured every human creature in attendance\n",
      "upon Monseigneur. In the outermost room were half a dozen exceptional\n",
      "people who had had, for a few years, some vague misgiving in them that\n",
      "things in general were going rather wrong. As a promising way of setting\n",
      "them right, half of the half-dozen had become members of a fantastic\n",
      "sect of Convulsionists, and were even then considering within themselves\n",
      "whether they should foam, rage, roar, and turn cataleptic on the\n",
      "spot--thereby setting up a highly intelligible finger-post to the\n",
      "Future, for Monseigneur’s guidance. Besides these Dervishes, were other\n",
      "three who had rushed into another sect, which mended matters with a\n",
      "jargon about “the Centre of Truth:” holding that Man had got out of the\n",
      "Centre of Truth--which did not need much demonstration--but had not got\n",
      "out of the Circumference, and that he was to be kept from flying out of\n",
      "the Circumference, and was even to be shoved back into the Centre,\n",
      "by fasting and seeing of spirits. Among these, accordingly, much\n",
      "discoursing with spirits went on--and it did a world of good which never\n",
      "became manifest.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, the comfort was, that all the company at the grand hotel of\n",
      "Monseigneur were perfectly dressed. If the Day of Judgment had only been\n",
      "ascertained to be a dress day, everybody there would have been eternally\n",
      "correct. Such frizzling and powdering and sticking up of hair, such\n",
      "delicate complexions artificially preserved and mended, such gallant\n",
      "swords to look at, and such delicate honour to the sense of smell, would\n",
      "surely keep anything going, for ever and ever. The exquisite gentlemen\n",
      "of the finest breeding wore little pendent trinkets that chinked as they\n",
      "languidly moved; these golden fetters rang like precious little bells;\n",
      "and what with that ringing, and with the rustle of silk and brocade and\n",
      "fine linen, there was a flutter in the air that fanned Saint Antoine and\n",
      "his devouring hunger far away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dress was the one unfailing talisman and charm used for keeping all\n",
      "things in their places. Everybody was dressed for a Fancy Ball that\n",
      "was never to leave off. From the Palace of the Tuileries, through\n",
      "Monseigneur and the whole Court, through the Chambers, the Tribunals\n",
      "of Justice, and all society (except the scarecrows), the Fancy Ball\n",
      "descended to the Common Executioner: who, in pursuance of the charm, was\n",
      "required to officiate “frizzled, powdered, in a gold-laced coat, pumps,\n",
      "and white silk stockings.” At the gallows and the wheel--the axe was a\n",
      "rarity--Monsieur Paris, as it was the episcopal mode among his brother\n",
      "Professors of the provinces, Monsieur Orleans, and the rest, to call\n",
      "him, presided in this dainty dress. And who among the company at\n",
      "Monseigneur’s reception in that seventeen hundred and eightieth year\n",
      "of our Lord, could possibly doubt, that a system rooted in a frizzled\n",
      "hangman, powdered, gold-laced, pumped, and white-silk stockinged, would\n",
      "see the very stars out!\n",
      "\n",
      "Monseigneur having eased his four men of their burdens and taken his\n",
      "chocolate, caused the doors of the Holiest of Holiests to be thrown\n",
      "open, and issued forth. Then, what submission, what cringing and\n",
      "fawning, what servility, what abject humiliation! As to bowing down in\n",
      "body and spirit, nothing in that way was left for Heaven--which may have\n",
      "been one among other reasons why the worshippers of Monseigneur never\n",
      "troubled it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bestowing a word of promise here and a smile there, a whisper on one\n",
      "happy slave and a wave of the hand on another, Monseigneur affably\n",
      "passed through his rooms to the remote region of the Circumference of\n",
      "Truth. There, Monseigneur turned, and came back again, and so in due\n",
      "course of time got himself shut up in his sanctuary by the chocolate\n",
      "sprites, and was seen no more.\n",
      "\n",
      "The show being over, the flutter in the air became quite a little storm,\n",
      "and the precious little bells went ringing downstairs. There was soon\n",
      "but one person left of all the crowd, and he, with his hat under his arm\n",
      "and his snuff-box in his hand, slowly passed among the mirrors on his\n",
      "way out.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I devote you,” said this person, stopping at the last door on his way,\n",
      "and turning in the direction of the sanctuary, “to the Devil!”\n",
      "\n",
      "With that, he shook the snuff from his fingers as if he had shaken the\n",
      "dust from his feet, and quietly walked downstairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was a man of about sixty, handsomely dressed, haughty in manner, and\n",
      "with a face like a fine mask. A face of a transparent paleness; every\n",
      "feature in it clearly defined; one set expression on it. The nose,\n",
      "beautifully formed otherwise, was very slightly pinched at the top\n",
      "of each nostril. In those two compressions, or dints, the only little\n",
      "change that the face ever showed, resided. They persisted in changing\n",
      "colour sometimes, and they would be occasionally dilated and contracted\n",
      "by something like a faint pulsation; then, they gave a look of\n",
      "treachery, and cruelty, to the whole countenance. Examined with\n",
      "attention, its capacity of helping such a look was to be found in the\n",
      "line of the mouth, and the lines of the orbits of the eyes, being much\n",
      "too horizontal and thin; still, in the effect of the face made, it was a\n",
      "handsome face, and a remarkable one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its owner went downstairs into the courtyard, got into his carriage, and\n",
      "drove away. Not many people had talked with him at the reception; he had\n",
      "stood in a little space apart, and Monseigneur might have been warmer\n",
      "in his manner. It appeared, under the circumstances, rather agreeable\n",
      "to him to see the common people dispersed before his horses, and\n",
      "often barely escaping from being run down. His man drove as if he were\n",
      "charging an enemy, and the furious recklessness of the man brought no\n",
      "check into the face, or to the lips, of the master. The complaint had\n",
      "sometimes made itself audible, even in that deaf city and dumb age,\n",
      "that, in the narrow streets without footways, the fierce patrician\n",
      "custom of hard driving endangered and maimed the mere vulgar in a\n",
      "barbarous manner. But, few cared enough for that to think of it a second\n",
      "time, and, in this matter, as in all others, the common wretches were\n",
      "left to get out of their difficulties as they could.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a wild rattle and clatter, and an inhuman abandonment of\n",
      "consideration not easy to be understood in these days, the carriage\n",
      "dashed through streets and swept round corners, with women screaming\n",
      "before it, and men clutching each other and clutching children out of\n",
      "its way. At last, swooping at a street corner by a fountain, one of its\n",
      "wheels came to a sickening little jolt, and there was a loud cry from a\n",
      "number of voices, and the horses reared and plunged.\n",
      "\n",
      "But for the latter inconvenience, the carriage probably would not have\n",
      "stopped; carriages were often known to drive on, and leave their wounded\n",
      "behind, and why not? But the frightened valet had got down in a hurry,\n",
      "and there were twenty hands at the horses’ bridles.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What has gone wrong?” said Monsieur, calmly looking out.\n",
      "\n",
      "A tall man in a nightcap had caught up a bundle from among the feet of\n",
      "the horses, and had laid it on the basement of the fountain, and was\n",
      "down in the mud and wet, howling over it like a wild animal.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pardon, Monsieur the Marquis!” said a ragged and submissive man, “it is\n",
      "a child.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why does he make that abominable noise? Is it his child?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Excuse me, Monsieur the Marquis--it is a pity--yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The fountain was a little removed; for the street opened, where it was,\n",
      "into a space some ten or twelve yards square. As the tall man suddenly\n",
      "got up from the ground, and came running at the carriage, Monsieur the\n",
      "Marquis clapped his hand for an instant on his sword-hilt.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Killed!” shrieked the man, in wild desperation, extending both arms at\n",
      "their length above his head, and staring at him. “Dead!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The people closed round, and looked at Monsieur the Marquis. There was\n",
      "nothing revealed by the many eyes that looked at him but watchfulness\n",
      "and eagerness; there was no visible menacing or anger. Neither did the\n",
      "people say anything; after the first cry, they had been silent, and they\n",
      "remained so. The voice of the submissive man who had spoken, was flat\n",
      "and tame in its extreme submission. Monsieur the Marquis ran his eyes\n",
      "over them all, as if they had been mere rats come out of their holes.\n",
      "\n",
      "He took out his purse.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is extraordinary to me,” said he, “that you people cannot take care\n",
      "of yourselves and your children. One or the other of you is for ever in\n",
      "the way. How do I know what injury you have done my horses. See! Give\n",
      "him that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He threw out a gold coin for the valet to pick up, and all the heads\n",
      "craned forward that all the eyes might look down at it as it fell. The\n",
      "tall man called out again with a most unearthly cry, “Dead!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He was arrested by the quick arrival of another man, for whom the rest\n",
      "made way. On seeing him, the miserable creature fell upon his shoulder,\n",
      "sobbing and crying, and pointing to the fountain, where some women were\n",
      "stooping over the motionless bundle, and moving gently about it. They\n",
      "were as silent, however, as the men.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know all, I know all,” said the last comer. “Be a brave man, my\n",
      "Gaspard! It is better for the poor little plaything to die so, than to\n",
      "live. It has died in a moment without pain. Could it have lived an hour\n",
      "as happily?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are a philosopher, you there,” said the Marquis, smiling. “How do\n",
      "they call you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They call me Defarge.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of what trade?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Monsieur the Marquis, vendor of wine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pick up that, philosopher and vendor of wine,” said the Marquis,\n",
      "throwing him another gold coin, “and spend it as you will. The horses\n",
      "there; are they right?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Without deigning to look at the assemblage a second time, Monsieur the\n",
      "Marquis leaned back in his seat, and was just being driven away with the\n",
      "air of a gentleman who had accidentally broke some common thing, and had\n",
      "paid for it, and could afford to pay for it; when his ease was suddenly\n",
      "disturbed by a coin flying into his carriage, and ringing on its floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hold!” said Monsieur the Marquis. “Hold the horses! Who threw that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked to the spot where Defarge the vendor of wine had stood, a\n",
      "moment before; but the wretched father was grovelling on his face on\n",
      "the pavement in that spot, and the figure that stood beside him was the\n",
      "figure of a dark stout woman, knitting.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You dogs!” said the Marquis, but smoothly, and with an unchanged front,\n",
      "except as to the spots on his nose: “I would ride over any of you very\n",
      "willingly, and exterminate you from the earth. If I knew which rascal\n",
      "threw at the carriage, and if that brigand were sufficiently near it, he\n",
      "should be crushed under the wheels.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So cowed was their condition, and so long and hard their experience of\n",
      "what such a man could do to them, within the law and beyond it, that not\n",
      "a voice, or a hand, or even an eye was raised. Among the men, not one.\n",
      "But the woman who stood knitting looked up steadily, and looked the\n",
      "Marquis in the face. It was not for his dignity to notice it; his\n",
      "contemptuous eyes passed over her, and over all the other rats; and he\n",
      "leaned back in his seat again, and gave the word “Go on!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He was driven on, and other carriages came whirling by in quick\n",
      "succession; the Minister, the State-Projector, the Farmer-General, the\n",
      "Doctor, the Lawyer, the Ecclesiastic, the Grand Opera, the Comedy, the\n",
      "whole Fancy Ball in a bright continuous flow, came whirling by. The rats\n",
      "had crept out of their holes to look on, and they remained looking\n",
      "on for hours; soldiers and police often passing between them and the\n",
      "spectacle, and making a barrier behind which they slunk, and through\n",
      "which they peeped. The father had long ago taken up his bundle and\n",
      "bidden himself away with it, when the women who had tended the bundle\n",
      "while it lay on the base of the fountain, sat there watching the running\n",
      "of the water and the rolling of the Fancy Ball--when the one woman who\n",
      "had stood conspicuous, knitting, still knitted on with the steadfastness\n",
      "of Fate. The water of the fountain ran, the swift river ran, the day ran\n",
      "into evening, so much life in the city ran into death according to rule,\n",
      "time and tide waited for no man, the rats were sleeping close together\n",
      "in their dark holes again, the Fancy Ball was lighted up at supper, all\n",

      "A beautiful landscape, with the corn bright in it, but not abundant.\n",
      "Patches of poor rye where corn should have been, patches of poor peas\n",
      "and beans, patches of most coarse vegetable substitutes for wheat. On\n",
      "inanimate nature, as on the men and women who cultivated it, a prevalent\n",
      "tendency towards an appearance of vegetating unwillingly--a dejected\n",
      "disposition to give up, and wither away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Monsieur the Marquis in his travelling carriage (which might have been\n",
      "lighter), conducted by four post-horses and two postilions, fagged up\n",
      "a steep hill. A blush on the countenance of Monsieur the Marquis was\n",
      "no impeachment of his high breeding; it was not from within; it was\n",
      "occasioned by an external circumstance beyond his control--the setting\n",
      "sun.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sunset struck so brilliantly into the travelling carriage when it\n",
      "gained the hill-top, that its occupant was steeped in crimson. “It will\n",
      "die out,” said Monsieur the Marquis, glancing at his hands, “directly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In effect, the sun was so low that it dipped at the moment. When the\n",
      "heavy drag had been adjusted to the wheel, and the carriage slid down\n",
      "hill, with a cinderous smell, in a cloud of dust, the red glow departed\n",
      "quickly; the sun and the Marquis going down together, there was no glow\n",
      "left when the drag was taken off.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, there remained a broken country, bold and open, a little village\n",
      "at the bottom of the hill, a broad sweep and rise beyond it, a\n",
      "church-tower, a windmill, a forest for the chase, and a crag with a\n",
      "fortress on it used as a prison. Round upon all these darkening objects\n",
      "as the night drew on, the Marquis looked, with the air of one who was\n",
      "coming near home.\n",
      "\n",
      "The village had its one poor street, with its poor brewery, poor\n",
      "tannery, poor tavern, poor stable-yard for relays of post-horses, poor\n",
      "fountain, all usual poor appointments. It had its poor people too. All\n",
      "its people were poor, and many of them were sitting at their doors,\n",
      "shredding spare onions and the like for supper, while many were at the\n",
      "fountain, washing leaves, and grasses, and any such small yieldings of\n",
      "the earth that could be eaten. Expressive signs of what made them poor,\n",
      "were not wanting; the tax for the state, the tax for the church, the tax\n",
      "for the lord, tax local and tax general, were to be paid here and to be\n",
      "paid there, according to solemn inscription in the little village, until\n",
      "the wonder was, that there was any village left unswallowed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Few children were to be seen, and no dogs. As to the men and women,\n",
      "their choice on earth was stated in the prospect--Life on the lowest\n",
      "terms that could sustain it, down in the little village under the mill;\n",
      "or captivity and Death in the dominant prison on the crag.\n",
      "\n",
      "Heralded by a courier in advance, and by the cracking of his postilions’\n",
      "whips, which twined snake-like about their heads in the evening air, as\n",
      "if he came attended by the Furies, Monsieur the Marquis drew up in\n",
      "his travelling carriage at the posting-house gate. It was hard by the\n",
      "fountain, and the peasants suspended their operations to look at him.\n",
      "He looked at them, and saw in them, without knowing it, the slow\n",
      "sure filing down of misery-worn face and figure, that was to make the\n",
      "meagreness of Frenchmen an English superstition which should survive the\n",
      "truth through the best part of a hundred years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Monsieur the Marquis cast his eyes over the submissive faces that\n",

      "of the blue cap without which he was nothing, still enlarged upon his\n",
      "man like a spectre, as long as they could bear it. By degrees, as they\n",
      "could bear no more, they dropped off one by one, and lights twinkled\n",
      "in little casements; which lights, as the casements darkened, and more\n",

      "\n",
      "The shadow of a large high-roofed house, and of many over-hanging trees,\n",

      "The Gorgon’s Head\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a heavy mass of building, that chateau of Monsieur the Marquis,\n",
      "with a large stone courtyard before it, and two stone sweeps of\n",
      "staircase meeting in a stone terrace before the principal door. A stony\n",
      "business altogether, with heavy stone balustrades, and stone urns, and\n",
      "stone flowers, and stone faces of men, and stone heads of lions, in\n",
      "all directions. As if the Gorgon’s head had surveyed it, when it was\n",
      "finished, two centuries ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "Up the broad flight of shallow steps, Monsieur the Marquis, flambeau\n",
      "preceded, went from his carriage, sufficiently disturbing the darkness\n",
      "to elicit loud remonstrance from an owl in the roof of the great pile\n",
      "of stable building away among the trees. All else was so quiet, that the\n",
      "flambeau carried up the steps, and the other flambeau held at the great\n",
      "door, burnt as if they were in a close room of state, instead of being\n",
      "in the open night-air. Other sound than the owl’s voice there was none,\n",
      "save the falling of a fountain into its stone basin; for, it was one of\n",
      "those dark nights that hold their breath by the hour together, and then\n",
      "heave a long low sigh, and hold their breath again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The great door clanged behind him, and Monsieur the Marquis crossed a\n",
      "hall grim with certain old boar-spears, swords, and knives of the chase;\n",
      "grimmer with certain heavy riding-rods and riding-whips, of which many a\n",
      "peasant, gone to his benefactor Death, had felt the weight when his lord\n",
      "was angry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Avoiding the larger rooms, which were dark and made fast for the night,\n",
      "Monsieur the Marquis, with his flambeau-bearer going on before, went up\n",
      "the staircase to a door in a corridor. This thrown open, admitted him\n",
      "to his own private apartment of three rooms: his bed-chamber and two\n",
      "others. High vaulted rooms with cool uncarpeted floors, great dogs upon\n",
      "the hearths for the burning of wood in winter time, and all luxuries\n",
      "befitting the state of a marquis in a luxurious age and country.\n",
      "The fashion of the last Louis but one, of the line that was never to\n",
      "break--the fourteenth Louis--was conspicuous in their rich furniture;\n",
      "but, it was diversified by many objects that were illustrations of old\n",
      "pages in the history of France.\n",
      "\n",
      "A supper-table was laid for two, in the third of the rooms; a round\n",
      "room, in one of the chateau’s four extinguisher-topped towers. A small\n",
      "lofty room, with its window wide open, and the wooden jalousie-blinds\n",
      "closed, so that the dark night only showed in slight horizontal lines of\n",
      "black, alternating with their broad lines of stone colour.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My nephew,” said the Marquis, glancing at the supper preparation; “they\n",
      "said he was not arrived.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor was he; but, he had been expected with Monseigneur.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! It is not probable he will arrive to-night; nevertheless, leave the\n",
      "table as it is. I shall be ready in a quarter of an hour.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In a quarter of an hour Monseigneur was ready, and sat down alone to his\n",
      "sumptuous and choice supper. His chair was opposite to the window, and\n",
      "he had taken his soup, and was raising his glass of Bordeaux to his\n",
      "lips, when he put it down.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is that?” he calmly asked, looking with attention at the\n",
      "horizontal lines of black and stone colour.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Monseigneur? That?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Outside the blinds. Open the blinds.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was done.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Monseigneur, it is nothing. The trees and the night are all that are\n",
      "here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The servant who spoke, had thrown the blinds wide, had looked out into\n",
      "the vacant darkness, and stood with that blank behind him, looking round\n",
      "for instructions.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good,” said the imperturbable master. “Close them again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That was done too, and the Marquis went on with his supper. He was\n",
      "half way through it, when he again stopped with his glass in his hand,\n",
      "hearing the sound of wheels. It came on briskly, and came up to the\n",
      "front of the chateau.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ask who is arrived.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the nephew of Monseigneur. He had been some few leagues behind\n",
      "Monseigneur, early in the afternoon. He had diminished the distance\n",
      "rapidly, but not so rapidly as to come up with Monseigneur on the road.\n",
      "He had heard of Monseigneur, at the posting-houses, as being before him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was to be told (said Monseigneur) that supper awaited him then and\n",
      "there, and that he was prayed to come to it. In a little while he came.\n",
      "He had been known in England as Charles Darnay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Monseigneur received him in a courtly manner, but they did not shake\n",
      "hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You left Paris yesterday, sir?” he said to Monseigneur, as he took his\n",
      "seat at table.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yesterday. And you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I come direct.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“From London?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have been a long time coming,” said the Marquis, with a smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "“On the contrary; I come direct.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pardon me! I mean, not a long time on the journey; a long time\n",
      "intending the journey.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have been detained by”--the nephew stopped a moment in his\n",
      "answer--“various business.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Without doubt,” said the polished uncle.\n",
      "\n",
      "So long as a servant was present, no other words passed between them.\n",
      "When coffee had been served and they were alone together, the nephew,\n",
      "looking at the uncle and meeting the eyes of the face that was like a\n",
      "fine mask, opened a conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have come back, sir, as you anticipate, pursuing the object that\n",
      "took me away. It carried me into great and unexpected peril; but it is\n",
      "a sacred object, and if it had carried me to death I hope it would have\n",
      "sustained me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not to death,” said the uncle; “it is not necessary to say, to death.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I doubt, sir,” returned the nephew, “whether, if it had carried me to\n",
      "the utmost brink of death, you would have cared to stop me there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The deepened marks in the nose, and the lengthening of the fine straight\n",
      "lines in the cruel face, looked ominous as to that; the uncle made a\n",
      "graceful gesture of protest, which was so clearly a slight form of good\n",
      "breeding that it was not reassuring.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed, sir,” pursued the nephew, “for anything I know, you may have\n",
      "expressly worked to give a more suspicious appearance to the suspicious\n",
      "circumstances that surrounded me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, no, no,” said the uncle, pleasantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, however that may be,” resumed the nephew, glancing at him with\n",
      "deep distrust, “I know that your diplomacy would stop me by any means,\n",
      "and would know no scruple as to means.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My friend, I told you so,” said the uncle, with a fine pulsation in the\n",
      "two marks. “Do me the favour to recall that I told you so, long ago.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I recall it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thank you,” said the Marquis--very sweetly indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "His tone lingered in the air, almost like the tone of a musical\n",
      "instrument.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In effect, sir,” pursued the nephew, “I believe it to be at once your\n",
      "bad fortune, and my good fortune, that has kept me out of a prison in\n",
      "France here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not quite understand,” returned the uncle, sipping his coffee.\n",
      "“Dare I ask you to explain?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I believe that if you were not in disgrace with the Court, and had not\n",
      "been overshadowed by that cloud for years past, a letter de cachet would\n",
      "have sent me to some fortress indefinitely.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is possible,” said the uncle, with great calmness. “For the honour\n",
      "of the family, I could even resolve to incommode you to that extent.\n",
      "Pray excuse me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I perceive that, happily for me, the Reception of the day before\n",
      "yesterday was, as usual, a cold one,” observed the nephew.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I would not say happily, my friend,” returned the uncle, with refined\n",
      "politeness; “I would not be sure of that. A good opportunity for\n",
      "consideration, surrounded by the advantages of solitude, might influence\n",
      "your destiny to far greater advantage than you influence it for\n",
      "yourself. But it is useless to discuss the question. I am, as you say,\n",
      "at a disadvantage. These little instruments of correction, these gentle\n",
      "aids to the power and honour of families, these slight favours that\n",
      "might so incommode you, are only to be obtained now by interest\n",
      "and importunity. They are sought by so many, and they are granted\n",
      "(comparatively) to so few! It used not to be so, but France in all such\n",
      "things is changed for the worse. Our not remote ancestors held the right\n",
      "of life and death over the surrounding vulgar. From this room, many such\n",
      "dogs have been taken out to be hanged; in the next room (my bedroom),\n",
      "one fellow, to our knowledge, was poniarded on the spot for professing\n",
      "some insolent delicacy respecting his daughter--_his_ daughter? We have\n",
      "lost many privileges; a new philosophy has become the mode; and the\n",
      "assertion of our station, in these days, might (I do not go so far as\n",
      "to say would, but might) cause us real inconvenience. All very bad, very\n",
      "bad!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Marquis took a gentle little pinch of snuff, and shook his head;\n",
      "as elegantly despondent as he could becomingly be of a country still\n",
      "containing himself, that great means of regeneration.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We have so asserted our station, both in the old time and in the modern\n",
      "time also,” said the nephew, gloomily, “that I believe our name to be\n",
      "more detested than any name in France.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let us hope so,” said the uncle. “Detestation of the high is the\n",
      "involuntary homage of the low.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is not,” pursued the nephew, in his former tone, “a face I can\n",
      "look at, in all this country round about us, which looks at me with any\n",
      "deference on it but the dark deference of fear and slavery.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A compliment,” said the Marquis, “to the grandeur of the family,\n",
      "merited by the manner in which the family has sustained its grandeur.\n",
      "Hah!” And he took another gentle little pinch of snuff, and lightly\n",
      "crossed his legs.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, when his nephew, leaning an elbow on the table, covered his eyes\n",
      "thoughtfully and dejectedly with his hand, the fine mask looked at\n",
      "him sideways with a stronger concentration of keenness, closeness,\n",
      "and dislike, than was comportable with its wearer’s assumption of\n",
      "indifference.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Repression is the only lasting philosophy. The dark deference of fear\n",
      "and slavery, my friend,” observed the Marquis, “will keep the dogs\n",
      "obedient to the whip, as long as this roof,” looking up to it, “shuts\n",
      "out the sky.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That might not be so long as the Marquis supposed. If a picture of the\n",
      "chateau as it was to be a very few years hence, and of fifty like it as\n",
      "they too were to be a very few years hence, could have been shown to\n",
      "him that night, he might have been at a loss to claim his own from\n",
      "the ghastly, fire-charred, plunder-wrecked rains. As for the roof\n",
      "he vaunted, he might have found _that_ shutting out the sky in a new\n",
      "way--to wit, for ever, from the eyes of the bodies into which its lead\n",
      "was fired, out of the barrels of a hundred thousand muskets.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Meanwhile,” said the Marquis, “I will preserve the honour and repose\n",
      "of the family, if you will not. But you must be fatigued. Shall we\n",
      "terminate our conference for the night?”\n",

      "“Sir,” said the nephew, “we have done wrong, and are reaping the fruits\n",
      "of wrong.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_We_ have done wrong?” repeated the Marquis, with an inquiring smile,\n",
      "and delicately pointing, first to his nephew, then to himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Our family; our honourable family, whose honour is of so much account\n",
      "to both of us, in such different ways. Even in my father’s time, we did\n",
      "a world of wrong, injuring every human creature who came between us and\n",
      "our pleasure, whatever it was. Why need I speak of my father’s time,\n",
      "when it is equally yours? Can I separate my father’s twin-brother, joint\n",
      "inheritor, and next successor, from himself?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Death has done that!” said the Marquis.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And has left me,” answered the nephew, “bound to a system that is\n",
      "frightful to me, responsible for it, but powerless in it; seeking to\n",
      "execute the last request of my dear mother’s lips, and obey the last\n",
      "look of my dear mother’s eyes, which implored me to have mercy and to\n",
      "redress; and tortured by seeking assistance and power in vain.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Seeking them from me, my nephew,” said the Marquis, touching him on the\n",
      "breast with his forefinger--they were now standing by the hearth--“you\n",
      "will for ever seek them in vain, be assured.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Every fine straight line in the clear whiteness of his face, was\n",
      "cruelly, craftily, and closely compressed, while he stood looking\n",
      "quietly at his nephew, with his snuff-box in his hand. Once again he\n",
      "touched him on the breast, as though his finger were the fine point of\n",
      "a small sword, with which, in delicate finesse, he ran him through the\n",
      "body, and said,\n",
      "\n",
      "“My friend, I will die, perpetuating the system under which I have\n",
      "lived.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When he had said it, he took a culminating pinch of snuff, and put his\n",
      "box in his pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Better to be a rational creature,” he added then, after ringing a small\n",
      "bell on the table, “and accept your natural destiny. But you are lost,\n",
      "Monsieur Charles, I see.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This property and France are lost to me,” said the nephew, sadly; “I\n",
      "renounce them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are they both yours to renounce? France may be, but is the property? It\n",
      "is scarcely worth mentioning; but, is it yet?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I had no intention, in the words I used, to claim it yet. If it passed\n",
      "to me from you, to-morrow--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Which I have the vanity to hope is not probable.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“--or twenty years hence--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You do me too much honour,” said the Marquis; “still, I prefer that\n",
      "supposition.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“--I would abandon it, and live otherwise and elsewhere. It is little to\n",
      "relinquish. What is it but a wilderness of misery and ruin!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hah!” said the Marquis, glancing round the luxurious room.\n",
      "\n",
      "“To the eye it is fair enough, here; but seen in its integrity,\n",
      "under the sky, and by the daylight, it is a crumbling tower of waste,\n",
      "mismanagement, extortion, debt, mortgage, oppression, hunger, nakedness,\n",
      "and suffering.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hah!” said the Marquis again, in a well-satisfied manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If it ever becomes mine, it shall be put into some hands better\n",
      "qualified to free it slowly (if such a thing is possible) from the\n",
      "weight that drags it down, so that the miserable people who cannot leave\n",
      "it and who have been long wrung to the last point of endurance, may, in\n",
      "another generation, suffer less; but it is not for me. There is a curse\n",
      "on it, and on all this land.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And you?” said the uncle. “Forgive my curiosity; do you, under your new\n",
      "philosophy, graciously intend to live?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I must do, to live, what others of my countrymen, even with nobility at\n",
      "their backs, may have to do some day--work.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In England, for example?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. The family honour, sir, is safe from me in this country. The\n",
      "family name can suffer from me in no other, for I bear it in no other.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The ringing of the bell had caused the adjoining bed-chamber to be\n",
      "lighted. It now shone brightly, through the door of communication. The\n",
      "Marquis looked that way, and listened for the retreating step of his\n",
      "valet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“England is very attractive to you, seeing how indifferently you have\n",
      "prospered there,” he observed then, turning his calm face to his nephew\n",
      "with a smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have already said, that for my prospering there, I am sensible I may\n",
      "be indebted to you, sir. For the rest, it is my Refuge.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They say, those boastful English, that it is the Refuge of many. You\n",
      "know a compatriot who has found a Refuge there? A Doctor?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“With a daughter?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said the Marquis. “You are fatigued. Good night!”\n",
      "\n",
      "As he bent his head in his most courtly manner, there was a secrecy\n",
      "in his smiling face, and he conveyed an air of mystery to those words,\n",
      "which struck the eyes and ears of his nephew forcibly. At the same\n",
      "time, the thin straight lines of the setting of the eyes, and the thin\n",
      "straight lips, and the markings in the nose, curved with a sarcasm that\n",
      "looked handsomely diabolic.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” repeated the Marquis. “A Doctor with a daughter. Yes. So\n",
      "commences the new philosophy! You are fatigued. Good night!”\n",
      "\n",
      "It would have been of as much avail to interrogate any stone face\n",
      "outside the chateau as to interrogate that face of his. The nephew\n",
      "looked at him, in vain, in passing on to the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good night!” said the uncle. “I look to the pleasure of seeing you\n",
      "again in the morning. Good repose! Light Monsieur my nephew to his\n",
      "chamber there!--And burn Monsieur my nephew in his bed, if you will,” he\n",
      "added to himself, before he rang his little bell again, and summoned his\n",
      "valet to his own bedroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "The valet come and gone, Monsieur the Marquis walked to and fro in his\n",
      "loose chamber-robe, to prepare himself gently for sleep, that hot still\n",
      "night. Rustling about the room, his softly-slippered feet making no\n",
      "noise on the floor, he moved like a refined tiger:--looked like some\n",
      "enchanted marquis of the impenitently wicked sort, in story, whose\n",
      "periodical change into tiger form was either just going off, or just\n",
      "coming on.\n",
      "\n",
      "He moved from end to end of his voluptuous bedroom, looking again at the\n",
      "scraps of the day’s journey that came unbidden into his mind; the slow\n",
      "toil up the hill at sunset, the setting sun, the descent, the mill, the\n",
      "prison on the crag, the little village in the hollow, the peasants at\n",
      "the fountain, and the mender of roads with his blue cap pointing out the\n",
      "chain under the carriage. That fountain suggested the Paris fountain,\n",
      "the little bundle lying on the step, the women bending over it, and the\n",
      "tall man with his arms up, crying, “Dead!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am cool now,” said Monsieur the Marquis, “and may go to bed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So, leaving only one light burning on the large hearth, he let his thin\n",
      "gauze curtains fall around him, and heard the night break its silence\n",
      "with a long sigh as he composed himself to sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stone faces on the outer walls stared blindly at the black night\n",
      "for three heavy hours; for three heavy hours, the horses in the stables\n",
      "rattled at their racks, the dogs barked, and the owl made a noise with\n",
      "very little resemblance in it to the noise conventionally assigned to\n",
      "the owl by men-poets. But it is the obstinate custom of such creatures\n",
      "hardly ever to say what is set down for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "For three heavy hours, the stone faces of the chateau, lion and human,\n",
      "stared blindly at the night. Dead darkness lay on all the landscape,\n",
      "dead darkness added its own hush to the hushing dust on all the roads.\n",
      "The burial-place had got to the pass that its little heaps of poor grass\n",
      "were undistinguishable from one another; the figure on the Cross might\n",
      "have come down, for anything that could be seen of it. In the village,\n",
      "taxers and taxed were fast asleep. Dreaming, perhaps, of banquets, as\n",
      "the starved usually do, and of ease and rest, as the driven slave and\n",
      "the yoked ox may, its lean inhabitants slept soundly, and were fed and\n",
      "freed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fountain in the village flowed unseen and unheard, and the fountain\n",
      "at the chateau dropped unseen and unheard--both melting away, like the\n",
      "minutes that were falling from the spring of Time--through three dark\n",
      "hours. Then, the grey water of both began to be ghostly in the light,\n",
      "and the eyes of the stone faces of the chateau were opened.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lighter and lighter, until at last the sun touched the tops of the still\n",
      "trees, and poured its radiance over the hill. In the glow, the water\n",
      "of the chateau fountain seemed to turn to blood, and the stone faces\n",
      "crimsoned. The carol of the birds was loud and high, and, on the\n",
      "weather-beaten sill of the great window of the bed-chamber of Monsieur\n",
      "the Marquis, one little bird sang its sweetest song with all its might.\n",
      "At this, the nearest stone face seemed to stare amazed, and, with open\n",
      "mouth and dropped under-jaw, looked awe-stricken.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the sun was full up, and movement began in the village. Casement\n",
      "windows opened, crazy doors were unbarred, and people came forth\n",
      "shivering--chilled, as yet, by the new sweet air. Then began the rarely\n",
      "lightened toil of the day among the village population. Some, to the\n",
      "fountain; some, to the fields; men and women here, to dig and delve; men\n",
      "and women there, to see to the poor live stock, and lead the bony cows\n",
      "out, to such pasture as could be found by the roadside. In the church\n",
      "and at the Cross, a kneeling figure or two; attendant on the latter\n",
      "prayers, the led cow, trying for a breakfast among the weeds at its\n",
      "foot.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chateau awoke later, as became its quality, but awoke gradually and\n",
      "surely. First, the lonely boar-spears and knives of the chase had been\n",
      "reddened as of old; then, had gleamed trenchant in the morning sunshine;\n",
      "now, doors and windows were thrown open, horses in their stables looked\n",
      "round over their shoulders at the light and freshness pouring in at\n",
      "doorways, leaves sparkled and rustled at iron-grated windows, dogs\n",
      "pulled hard at their chains, and reared impatient to be loosed.\n",
      "\n",
      "All these trivial incidents belonged to the routine of life, and the\n",
      "return of morning. Surely, not so the ringing of the great bell of the\n",
      "chateau, nor the running up and down the stairs; nor the hurried\n",
      "figures on the terrace; nor the booting and tramping here and there and\n",
      "everywhere, nor the quick saddling of horses and riding away?\n",
      "\n",
      "What winds conveyed this hurry to the grizzled mender of roads, already\n",
      "at work on the hill-top beyond the village, with his day’s dinner (not\n",
      "much to carry) lying in a bundle that it was worth no crow’s while to\n",
      "peck at, on a heap of stones? Had the birds, carrying some grains of it\n",
      "to a distance, dropped one over him as they sow chance seeds? Whether or\n",
      "no, the mender of roads ran, on the sultry morning, as if for his life,\n",
      "down the hill, knee-high in dust, and never stopped till he got to the\n",
      "fountain.\n",
      "\n",
      "All the people of the village were at the fountain, standing about\n",
      "in their depressed manner, and whispering low, but showing no other\n",
      "emotions than grim curiosity and surprise. The led cows, hastily brought\n",
      "in and tethered to anything that would hold them, were looking stupidly\n",
      "on, or lying down chewing the cud of nothing particularly repaying their\n",
      "trouble, which they had picked up in their interrupted saunter. Some of\n",
      "the people of the chateau, and some of those of the posting-house, and\n",
      "all the taxing authorities, were armed more or less, and were crowded\n",
      "on the other side of the little street in a purposeless way, that was\n",
      "highly fraught with nothing. Already, the mender of roads had penetrated\n",
      "into the midst of a group of fifty particular friends, and was smiting\n",
      "himself in the breast with his blue cap. What did all this portend,\n",
      "and what portended the swift hoisting-up of Monsieur Gabelle behind\n",
      "a servant on horseback, and the conveying away of the said Gabelle\n",
      "(double-laden though the horse was), at a gallop, like a new version of\n",
      "the German ballad of Leonora?\n",
      "\n",
      "It portended that there was one stone face too many, up at the chateau.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Gorgon had surveyed the building again in the night, and had added\n",
      "the one stone face wanting; the stone face for which it had waited\n",
      "through about two hundred years.\n",
      "\n",
      "It lay back on the pillow of Monsieur the Marquis. It was like a fine\n",
      "mask, suddenly startled, made angry, and petrified. Driven home into the\n",
      "heart of the stone figure attached to it, was a knife. Round its hilt\n",
      "was a frill of paper, on which was scrawled:\n",

      "More months, to the number of twelve, had come and gone, and Mr. Charles\n",
      "Darnay was established in England as a higher teacher of the French\n",
      "language who was conversant with French literature. In this age, he\n",
      "would have been a Professor; in that age, he was a Tutor. He read with\n",
      "young men who could find any leisure and interest for the study of a\n",
      "living tongue spoken all over the world, and he cultivated a taste for\n",
      "its stores of knowledge and fancy. He could write of them, besides, in\n",
      "sound English, and render them into sound English. Such masters were not\n",
      "at that time easily found; Princes that had been, and Kings that were\n",
      "to be, were not yet of the Teacher class, and no ruined nobility had\n",
      "dropped out of Tellson’s ledgers, to turn cooks and carpenters. As a\n",
      "tutor, whose attainments made the student’s way unusually pleasant and\n",
      "profitable, and as an elegant translator who brought something to his\n",

      "known and encouraged. He was well acquainted, more-over, with the\n",
      "circumstances of his country, and those were of ever-growing interest.\n",
      "So, with great perseverance and untiring industry, he prospered.\n",
      "\n",
      "In London, he had expected neither to walk on pavements of gold, nor\n",
      "to lie on beds of roses; if he had had any such exalted expectation, he\n",

      "A certain portion of his time was passed at Cambridge, where he\n",

      "Now, from the days when it was always summer in Eden, to these days\n",
      "when it is mostly winter in fallen latitudes, the world of a man has\n",
      "invariably gone one way--Charles Darnay’s way--the way of the love of a\n",

      "He had loved Lucie Manette from the hour of his danger. He had never\n",

      "confronted with his own on the edge of the grave that had been dug for\n",

      "long, dusty roads--the solid stone chateau which had itself become the\n",

      "much as a single spoken word, disclosed to her the state of his heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "That he had his reasons for this, he knew full well. It was again a\n",
      "summer day when, lately arrived in London from his college occupation,\n",
      "he turned into the quiet corner in Soho, bent on seeking an opportunity\n",
      "of opening his mind to Doctor Manette. It was the close of the summer\n",
      "day, and he knew Lucie to be out with Miss Pross.\n",

      "He found the Doctor reading in his arm-chair at a window. The energy\n",
      "which had at once supported him under his old sufferings and aggravated\n",
      "their sharpness, had been gradually restored to him. He was now a\n",
      "very energetic man indeed, with great firmness of purpose, strength\n",
      "of resolution, and vigour of action. In his recovered energy he was\n",
      "sometimes a little fitful and sudden, as he had at first been in the\n",
      "exercise of his other recovered faculties; but, this had never been\n",
      "frequently observable, and had grown more and more rare.\n",
      "\n",
      "He studied much, slept little, sustained a great deal of fatigue with\n",
      "ease, and was equably cheerful. To him, now entered Charles Darnay, at\n",

      "with the affection and duty of a daughter who has become a woman, there\n",

      "years and character, united to the trustfulness and attachment of the\n",
      "early days in which you were lost to her. I know perfectly well that if\n",
      "you had been restored to her from the world beyond this life, you could\n",
      "hardly be invested, in her sight, with a more sacred character than that\n",
      "in which you are always with her. I know that when she is clinging to\n",
      "you, the hands of baby, girl, and woman, all in one, are round your\n",
      "neck. I know that in loving you she sees and loves her mother at her\n",

      "in a happier future; I look only to sharing your fortunes, sharing your\n",

      "to her before he left town for the Long Vacation. After some mental\n",
      "debating of the point, he came to the conclusion that it would be as\n",
      "well to get all the preliminaries done with, and they could then arrange\n",
      "at their leisure whether he should give her his hand a week or two\n",
      "before Michaelmas Term, or in the little Christmas vacation between it\n",
      "and Hilary.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to the strength of his case, he had not a doubt about it, but clearly\n",
      "saw his way to the verdict. Argued with the jury on substantial worldly\n",
      "grounds--the only grounds ever worth taking into account--it was a\n",
      "plain case, and had not a weak spot in it. He called himself for the\n",
      "plaintiff, there was no getting over his evidence, the counsel for\n",
      "the defendant threw up his brief, and the jury did not even turn to\n",

      "Stryver’s mind to enter the bank, and reveal to Mr. Lorry the brightness\n",
      "of the Soho horizon. So, he pushed open the door with the weak rattle\n",
      "in its throat, stumbled down the two steps, got past the two ancient\n",
      "cashiers, and shouldered himself into the musty back closet where Mr.\n",
      "Lorry sat at great books ruled for figures, with perpendicular iron\n",

      "under the clouds were a sum.\n",

      "\n",
      "It was Stryver’s grand peculiarity that he always seemed too big for any\n",
      "place, or space. He was so much too big for Tellson’s, that old clerks\n",
      "in distant corners looked up with looks of remonstrance, as though he\n",

      "recommend under the circumstances, “How do you do, Mr. Stryver? How do\n",

      "of shaking hands, always to be seen in any clerk at Tellson’s who shook\n",
      "hands with a customer when the House pervaded the air. He shook in a\n",

      "What may your meaning be, Mr. Lorry?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My meaning,” answered the man of business, “is, of course, friendly and\n",
      "appreciative, and that it does you the greatest credit, and--in short,\n",
      "my meaning is everything you could desire. But--really, you know, Mr.\n",
      "Stryver--” Mr. Lorry paused, and shook his head at him in the oddest\n",

      "“you know there really is so much too much of you!”\n",
      "\n",

      "eligible, you are eligible.”\n",

      "“Then what on earth is your meaning, Mr. Lorry?” demanded Stryver,\n",
      "perceptibly crestfallen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well! I--Were you going there now?” asked Mr. Lorry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Straight!” said Stryver, with a plump of his fist on the desk.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then I think I wouldn’t, if I was you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why?” said Stryver. “Now, I’ll put you in a corner,” forensically\n",
      "shaking a forefinger at him. “You are a man of business and bound to\n",
      "have a reason. State your reason. Why wouldn’t you go?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because,” said Mr. Lorry, “I wouldn’t go on such an object without\n",

      "\n",
      "“Here’s a man of business--a man of years--a man of experience--_in_\n",
      "a Bank,” said Stryver; “and having summed up three leading reasons for\n",
      "complete success, he says there’s no reason at all! Says it with his\n",
      "head on!” Mr. Stryver remarked upon the peculiarity as if it would have\n",
      "been infinitely less remarkable if he had said it with his head off.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When I speak of success, I speak of success with the young lady; and\n",
      "when I speak of causes and reasons to make success probable, I speak of\n",
      "causes and reasons that will tell as such with the young lady. The young\n",

      "young lady. The young lady goes before all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then you mean to tell me, Mr. Lorry,” said Stryver, squaring his\n",
      "elbows, “that it is your deliberate opinion that the young lady at\n",
      "present in question is a mincing Fool?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not exactly so. I mean to tell you, Mr. Stryver,” said Mr. Lorry,\n",
      "reddening, “that I will hear no disrespectful word of that young lady\n",
      "from any lips; and that if I knew any man--which I hope I do not--whose\n",
      "taste was so coarse, and whose temper was so overbearing, that he could\n",
      "not restrain himself from speaking disrespectfully of that young lady at\n",
      "this desk, not even Tellson’s should prevent my giving him a piece of my\n",
      "mind.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The necessity of being angry in a suppressed tone had put Mr. Stryver’s\n",
      "blood-vessels into a dangerous state when it was his turn to be angry;\n",
      "Mr. Lorry’s veins, methodical as their courses could usually be, were in\n",
      "no better state now it was his turn.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is what I mean to tell you, sir,” said Mr. Lorry. “Pray let there\n",
      "be no mistake about it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Stryver sucked the end of a ruler for a little while, and then stood\n",
      "hitting a tune out of his teeth with it, which probably gave him the\n",
      "toothache. He broke the awkward silence by saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is something new to me, Mr. Lorry. You deliberately advise me not\n",
      "to go up to Soho and offer myself--_my_self, Stryver of the King’s Bench\n",

      "“Very good. Then I give it, and you have repeated it correctly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And all I can say of it is,” laughed Stryver with a vexed laugh, “that\n",
      "this--ha, ha!--beats everything past, present, and to come.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now understand me,” pursued Mr. Lorry. “As a man of business, I am\n",
      "not justified in saying anything about this matter, for, as a man of\n",
      "business, I know nothing of it. But, as an old fellow, who has carried\n",
      "Miss Manette in his arms, who is the trusted friend of Miss Manette and\n",
      "of her father too, and who has a great affection for them both, I have\n",
      "spoken. The confidence is not of my seeking, recollect. Now, you think I\n",
      "may not be right?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not I!” said Stryver, whistling. “I can’t undertake to find third\n",
      "parties in common sense; I can only find it for myself. I suppose sense\n",
      "in certain quarters; you suppose mincing bread-and-butter nonsense. It’s\n",
      "new to me, but you are right, I dare say.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What I suppose, Mr. Stryver, I claim to characterise for myself--And\n",
      "understand me, sir,” said Mr. Lorry, quickly flushing again, “I\n",
      "will not--not even at Tellson’s--have it characterised for me by any\n",
      "gentleman breathing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There! I beg your pardon!” said Stryver.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Granted. Thank you. Well, Mr. Stryver, I was about to say:--it might be\n",
      "painful to you to find yourself mistaken, it might be painful to Doctor\n",
      "Manette to have the task of being explicit with you, it might be very\n",
      "painful to Miss Manette to have the task of being explicit with you. You\n",
      "know the terms upon which I have the honour and happiness to stand with\n",
      "the family. If you please, committing you in no way, representing you\n",
      "in no way, I will undertake to correct my advice by the exercise of a\n",
      "little new observation and judgment expressly brought to bear upon\n",
      "it. If you should then be dissatisfied with it, you can but test its\n",
      "soundness for yourself; if, on the other hand, you should be satisfied\n",
      "with it, and it should be what it now is, it may spare all sides what is\n",
      "best spared. What do you say?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How long would you keep me in town?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! It is only a question of a few hours. I could go to Soho in the\n",
      "evening, and come to your chambers afterwards.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then I say yes,” said Stryver: “I won’t go up there now, I am not so\n",
      "hot upon it as that comes to; I say yes, and I shall expect you to look\n",
      "in to-night. Good morning.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Mr. Stryver turned and burst out of the Bank, causing such a\n",
      "concussion of air on his passage through, that to stand up against it\n",
      "bowing behind the two counters, required the utmost remaining strength\n",
      "of the two ancient clerks. Those venerable and feeble persons were\n",
      "always seen by the public in the act of bowing, and were popularly\n",
      "believed, when they had bowed a customer out, still to keep on bowing in\n",
      "the empty office until they bowed another customer in.\n",
      "\n",
      "The barrister was keen enough to divine that the banker would not have\n",
      "gone so far in his expression of opinion on any less solid ground than\n",
      "moral certainty. Unprepared as he was for the large pill he had to\n",
      "swallow, he got it down. “And now,” said Mr. Stryver, shaking his\n",
      "forensic forefinger at the Temple in general, when it was down, “my way\n",
      "out of this, is, to put you all in the wrong.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a bit of the art of an Old Bailey tactician, in which he found\n",
      "great relief. “You shall not put me in the wrong, young lady,” said Mr.\n",
      "Stryver; “I’ll do that for you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Accordingly, when Mr. Lorry called that night as late as ten o’clock,\n",
      "Mr. Stryver, among a quantity of books and papers littered out for the\n",
      "purpose, seemed to have nothing less on his mind than the subject of\n",
      "the morning. He even showed surprise when he saw Mr. Lorry, and was\n",
      "altogether in an absent and preoccupied state.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well!” said that good-natured emissary, after a full half-hour of\n",
      "bootless attempts to bring him round to the question. “I have been to\n",
      "Soho.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To Soho?” repeated Mr. Stryver, coldly. “Oh, to be sure! What am I\n",
      "thinking of!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And I have no doubt,” said Mr. Lorry, “that I was right in the\n",
      "conversation we had. My opinion is confirmed, and I reiterate my\n",
      "advice.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I assure you,” returned Mr. Stryver, in the friendliest way, “that I\n",
      "am sorry for it on your account, and sorry for it on the poor father’s\n",
      "account. I know this must always be a sore subject with the family; let\n",
      "us say no more about it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t understand you,” said Mr. Lorry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I dare say not,” rejoined Stryver, nodding his head in a smoothing and\n",
      "final way; “no matter, no matter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But it does matter,” Mr. Lorry urged.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No it doesn’t; I assure you it doesn’t. Having supposed that there was\n",
      "sense where there is no sense, and a laudable ambition where there is\n",
      "not a laudable ambition, I am well out of my mistake, and no harm is\n",
      "done. Young women have committed similar follies often before, and have\n",
      "repented them in poverty and obscurity often before. In an unselfish\n",
      "aspect, I am sorry that the thing is dropped, because it would have been\n",
      "a bad thing for me in a worldly point of view; in a selfish aspect, I am\n",
      "glad that the thing has dropped, because it would have been a bad thing\n",
      "for me in a worldly point of view--it is hardly necessary to say I could\n",
      "have gained nothing by it. There is no harm at all done. I have not\n",
      "proposed to the young lady, and, between ourselves, I am by no means\n",
      "certain, on reflection, that I ever should have committed myself to\n",
      "that extent. Mr. Lorry, you cannot control the mincing vanities and\n",
      "giddinesses of empty-headed girls; you must not expect to do it, or you\n",
      "will always be disappointed. Now, pray say no more about it. I tell you,\n",
      "I regret it on account of others, but I am satisfied on my own account.\n",
      "And I am really very much obliged to you for allowing me to sound you,\n",

      "you were right, it never would have done.”\n",

      "\n",
      "She had never seen him softened, and was much distressed. He knew her to\n",

      "one who died young. All my life might have been.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, Mr. Carton. I am sure that the best part of it might still be; I am\n",

      "you have been the last dream of my soul. In my degradation I have not\n",
      "been so degraded but that the sight of you with your father, and of this\n",
      "home made such a home by you, has stirred old shadows that I thought had\n",
      "died out of me. Since I knew you, I have been troubled by a remorse that\n",
      "I thought would never reproach me again, and have heard whispers from\n",
      "old voices impelling me upward, that I thought were silent for ever. I\n",
      "have had unformed ideas of striving afresh, beginning anew, shaking off\n",
      "sloth and sensuality, and fighting out the abandoned fight. A dream, all\n",

      "weakness, to wish you to know with what a sudden mastery you kindled me,\n",
      "heap of ashes that I am, into fire--a fire, however, inseparable in\n",

      "\n",
      "“The utmost good that I am capable of now, Miss Manette, I have come\n",
      "here to realise. Let me carry through the rest of my misdirected life,\n",
      "the remembrance that I opened my heart to you, last of all the world;\n",

      "deplore and pity.”\n",
      "\n",

      "the hour of my death, I shall hold sacred the one good remembrance--and\n",
      "shall thank and bless you for it--that my last avowal of myself was made\n",

      "sad to think how much he had thrown away, and how much he every day kept\n",

      "wretch who creeps along the streets. Be comforted! But, within myself, I\n",
      "shall always be, towards you, what I am now, though outwardly I shall be\n",
      "what you have heretofore seen me. The last supplication but one I make\n",

      "it, I know, but it rises out of my soul. For you, and for any dear to\n",
      "you, I would do anything. If my career were of that better kind that\n",
      "there was any opportunity or capacity of sacrifice in it, I would\n",
      "embrace any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you. Try to hold\n",

      "The Honest Tradesman\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To the eyes of Mr. Jeremiah Cruncher, sitting on his stool in\n",
      "Fleet-street with his grisly urchin beside him, a vast number and\n",
      "variety of objects in movement were every day presented. Who could sit\n",
      "upon anything in Fleet-street during the busy hours of the day, and\n",
      "not be dazed and deafened by two immense processions, one ever tending\n",
      "westward with the sun, the other ever tending eastward from the sun,\n",
      "both ever tending to the plains beyond the range of red and purple where\n",
      "the sun goes down!\n",
      "\n",
      "With his straw in his mouth, Mr. Cruncher sat watching the two streams,\n",
      "like the heathen rustic who has for several centuries been on duty\n",
      "watching one stream--saving that Jerry had no expectation of their ever\n",
      "running dry. Nor would it have been an expectation of a hopeful kind,\n",
      "since a small part of his income was derived from the pilotage of timid\n",
      "women (mostly of a full habit and past the middle term of life) from\n",
      "Tellson’s side of the tides to the opposite shore. Brief as such\n",
      "companionship was in every separate instance, Mr. Cruncher never failed\n",
      "to become so interested in the lady as to express a strong desire to\n",
      "have the honour of drinking her very good health. And it was from\n",
      "the gifts bestowed upon him towards the execution of this benevolent\n",
      "purpose, that he recruited his finances, as just now observed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Time was, when a poet sat upon a stool in a public place, and mused in\n",
      "the sight of men. Mr. Cruncher, sitting on a stool in a public place,\n",
      "but not being a poet, mused as little as possible, and looked about him.\n",
      "\n",
      "It fell out that he was thus engaged in a season when crowds were\n",
      "few, and belated women few, and when his affairs in general were so\n",
      "unprosperous as to awaken a strong suspicion in his breast that Mrs.\n",
      "Cruncher must have been “flopping” in some pointed manner, when an\n",
      "unusual concourse pouring down Fleet-street westward, attracted his\n",
      "attention. Looking that way, Mr. Cruncher made out that some kind of\n",
      "funeral was coming along, and that there was popular objection to this\n",
      "funeral, which engendered uproar.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Young Jerry,” said Mr. Cruncher, turning to his offspring, “it’s a\n",
      "buryin’.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hooroar, father!” cried Young Jerry.\n",
      "\n",
      "The young gentleman uttered this exultant sound with mysterious\n",
      "significance. The elder gentleman took the cry so ill, that he watched\n",
      "his opportunity, and smote the young gentleman on the ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What d’ye mean? What are you hooroaring at? What do you want to conwey\n",
      "to your own father, you young Rip? This boy is a getting too many for\n",
      "_me_!” said Mr. Cruncher, surveying him. “Him and his hooroars! Don’t\n",
      "let me hear no more of you, or you shall feel some more of me. D’ye\n",
      "hear?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I warn’t doing no harm,” Young Jerry protested, rubbing his cheek.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Drop it then,” said Mr. Cruncher; “I won’t have none of _your_ no\n",
      "harms. Get a top of that there seat, and look at the crowd.”\n",
      "\n",
      "His son obeyed, and the crowd approached; they were bawling and hissing\n",
      "round a dingy hearse and dingy mourning coach, in which mourning coach\n",
      "there was only one mourner, dressed in the dingy trappings that were\n",
      "considered essential to the dignity of the position. The position\n",
      "appeared by no means to please him, however, with an increasing rabble\n",
      "surrounding the coach, deriding him, making grimaces at him, and\n",
      "incessantly groaning and calling out: “Yah! Spies! Tst! Yaha! Spies!”\n",
      " with many compliments too numerous and forcible to repeat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Funerals had at all times a remarkable attraction for Mr. Cruncher; he\n",
      "always pricked up his senses, and became excited, when a funeral passed\n",
      "Tellson’s. Naturally, therefore, a funeral with this uncommon attendance\n",
      "excited him greatly, and he asked of the first man who ran against him:\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is it, brother? What’s it about?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_I_ don’t know,” said the man. “Spies! Yaha! Tst! Spies!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He asked another man. “Who is it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_I_ don’t know,” returned the man, clapping his hands to his mouth\n",
      "nevertheless, and vociferating in a surprising heat and with the\n",
      "greatest ardour, “Spies! Yaha! Tst, tst! Spi--ies!”\n",
      "\n",
      "At length, a person better informed on the merits of the case, tumbled\n",
      "against him, and from this person he learned that the funeral was the\n",
      "funeral of one Roger Cly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Was he a spy?” asked Mr. Cruncher.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Old Bailey spy,” returned his informant. “Yaha! Tst! Yah! Old Bailey\n",
      "Spi--i--ies!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, to be sure!” exclaimed Jerry, recalling the Trial at which he had\n",
      "assisted. “I’ve seen him. Dead, is he?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dead as mutton,” returned the other, “and can’t be too dead. Have ’em\n",
      "out, there! Spies! Pull ’em out, there! Spies!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea was so acceptable in the prevalent absence of any idea,\n",
      "that the crowd caught it up with eagerness, and loudly repeating the\n",
      "suggestion to have ’em out, and to pull ’em out, mobbed the two vehicles\n",
      "so closely that they came to a stop. On the crowd’s opening the coach\n",
      "doors, the one mourner scuffled out by himself and was in their hands\n",
      "for a moment; but he was so alert, and made such good use of his time,\n",
      "that in another moment he was scouring away up a bye-street, after\n",
      "shedding his cloak, hat, long hatband, white pocket-handkerchief, and\n",
      "other symbolical tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "These, the people tore to pieces and scattered far and wide with great\n",
      "enjoyment, while the tradesmen hurriedly shut up their shops; for a\n",
      "crowd in those times stopped at nothing, and was a monster much dreaded.\n",
      "They had already got the length of opening the hearse to take the coffin\n",
      "out, when some brighter genius proposed instead, its being escorted to\n",
      "its destination amidst general rejoicing. Practical suggestions being\n",
      "much needed, this suggestion, too, was received with acclamation, and\n",
      "the coach was immediately filled with eight inside and a dozen out,\n",
      "while as many people got on the roof of the hearse as could by any\n",
      "exercise of ingenuity stick upon it. Among the first of these volunteers\n",
      "was Jerry Cruncher himself, who modestly concealed his spiky head from\n",
      "the observation of Tellson’s, in the further corner of the mourning\n",
      "coach.\n",
      "\n",
      "The officiating undertakers made some protest against these changes in\n",
      "the ceremonies; but, the river being alarmingly near, and several voices\n",
      "remarking on the efficacy of cold immersion in bringing refractory\n",
      "members of the profession to reason, the protest was faint and brief.\n",
      "The remodelled procession started, with a chimney-sweep driving the\n",
      "hearse--advised by the regular driver, who was perched beside him, under\n",
      "close inspection, for the purpose--and with a pieman, also attended\n",
      "by his cabinet minister, driving the mourning coach. A bear-leader, a\n",
      "popular street character of the time, was impressed as an additional\n",
      "ornament, before the cavalcade had gone far down the Strand; and his\n",
      "bear, who was black and very mangy, gave quite an Undertaking air to\n",
      "that part of the procession in which he walked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, with beer-drinking, pipe-smoking, song-roaring, and infinite\n",
      "caricaturing of woe, the disorderly procession went its way, recruiting\n",
      "at every step, and all the shops shutting up before it. Its destination\n",
      "was the old church of Saint Pancras, far off in the fields. It got there\n",
      "in course of time; insisted on pouring into the burial-ground; finally,\n",
      "accomplished the interment of the deceased Roger Cly in its own way, and\n",
      "highly to its own satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dead man disposed of, and the crowd being under the necessity of\n",
      "providing some other entertainment for itself, another brighter\n",
      "genius (or perhaps the same) conceived the humour of impeaching casual\n",
      "passers-by, as Old Bailey spies, and wreaking vengeance on them. Chase\n",
      "was given to some scores of inoffensive persons who had never been near\n",
      "the Old Bailey in their lives, in the realisation of this fancy, and\n",
      "they were roughly hustled and maltreated. The transition to the sport of\n",
      "window-breaking, and thence to the plundering of public-houses, was easy\n",
      "and natural. At last, after several hours, when sundry summer-houses had\n",
      "been pulled down, and some area-railings had been torn up, to arm\n",
      "the more belligerent spirits, a rumour got about that the Guards were\n",
      "coming. Before this rumour, the crowd gradually melted away, and perhaps\n",
      "the Guards came, and perhaps they never came, and this was the usual\n",
      "progress of a mob.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Cruncher did not assist at the closing sports, but had remained\n",
      "behind in the churchyard, to confer and condole with the undertakers.\n",
      "The place had a soothing influence on him. He procured a pipe from a\n",
      "neighbouring public-house, and smoked it, looking in at the railings and\n",
      "maturely considering the spot.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jerry,” said Mr. Cruncher, apostrophising himself in his usual way,\n",
      "“you see that there Cly that day, and you see with your own eyes that he\n",
      "was a young ’un and a straight made ’un.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Having smoked his pipe out, and ruminated a little longer, he turned\n",
      "himself about, that he might appear, before the hour of closing, on his\n",
      "station at Tellson’s. Whether his meditations on mortality had touched\n",
      "his liver, or whether his general health had been previously at all\n",
      "amiss, or whether he desired to show a little attention to an eminent\n",
      "man, is not so much to the purpose, as that he made a short call upon\n",
      "his medical adviser--a distinguished surgeon--on his way back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Young Jerry relieved his father with dutiful interest, and reported No\n",
      "job in his absence. The bank closed, the ancient clerks came out, the\n",
      "usual watch was set, and Mr. Cruncher and his son went home to tea.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, I tell you where it is!” said Mr. Cruncher to his wife, on\n",
      "entering. “If, as a honest tradesman, my wenturs goes wrong to-night, I\n",
      "shall make sure that you’ve been praying again me, and I shall work you\n",
      "for it just the same as if I seen you do it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The dejected Mrs. Cruncher shook her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, you’re at it afore my face!” said Mr. Cruncher, with signs of\n",
      "angry apprehension.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am saying nothing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, then; don’t meditate nothing. You might as well flop as meditate.\n",
      "You may as well go again me one way as another. Drop it altogether.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, Jerry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, Jerry,” repeated Mr. Cruncher sitting down to tea. “Ah! It _is_\n",
      "yes, Jerry. That’s about it. You may say yes, Jerry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Cruncher had no particular meaning in these sulky corroborations,\n",
      "but made use of them, as people not unfrequently do, to express general\n",
      "ironical dissatisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You and your yes, Jerry,” said Mr. Cruncher, taking a bite out of his\n",
      "bread-and-butter, and seeming to help it down with a large invisible\n",
      "oyster out of his saucer. “Ah! I think so. I believe you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are going out to-night?” asked his decent wife, when he took\n",

      "\n",
      "“No, you mayn’t. I’m a going--as your mother knows--a fishing. That’s\n",

      "most vigilant watch on Mrs. Cruncher, and sullenly holding her in\n",
      "conversation that she might be prevented from meditating any petitions\n",
      "to his disadvantage. With this view, he urged his son to hold her in\n",
      "conversation also, and led the unfortunate woman a hard life by dwelling\n",
      "on any causes of complaint he could bring against her, rather than\n",
      "he would leave her for a moment to her own reflections. The devoutest\n",
      "person could have rendered no greater homage to the efficacy of an\n",

      "flopping tricks and your unfeeling conduct. Look at your boy: he _is_\n",

      "Thus the evening wore away with the Cruncher family, until Young Jerry\n",

      "obeyed them. Mr. Cruncher beguiled the earlier watches of the night with\n",
      "solitary pipes, and did not start upon his excursion until nearly one\n",
      "o’clock. Towards that small and ghostly hour, he rose up from his chair,\n",
      "took a key out of his pocket, opened a locked cupboard, and brought\n",
      "forth a sack, a crowbar of convenient size, a rope and chain, and other\n",
      "fishing tackle of that nature. Disposing these articles about him\n",
      "in skilful manner, he bestowed a parting defiance on Mrs. Cruncher,\n",
      "extinguished the light, and went out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Young Jerry, who had only made a feint of undressing when he went to\n",
      "bed, was not long after his father. Under cover of the darkness he\n",
      "followed out of the room, followed down the stairs, followed down the\n",
      "court, followed out into the streets. He was in no uneasiness concerning\n",
      "his getting into the house again, for it was full of lodgers, and the\n",
      "door stood ajar all night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Impelled by a laudable ambition to study the art and mystery of his\n",
      "father’s honest calling, Young Jerry, keeping as close to house fronts,\n",
      "walls, and doorways, as his eyes were close to one another, held his\n",
      "honoured parent in view. The honoured parent steering Northward, had not\n",
      "gone far, when he was joined by another disciple of Izaak Walton, and\n",
      "the two trudged on together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Within half an hour from the first starting, they were beyond the\n",
      "winking lamps, and the more than winking watchmen, and were out upon a\n",
      "lonely road. Another fisherman was picked up here--and that so silently,\n",
      "that if Young Jerry had been superstitious, he might have supposed the\n",
      "second follower of the gentle craft to have, all of a sudden, split\n",
      "himself into two.\n",
      "\n",
      "The three went on, and Young Jerry went on, until the three stopped\n",
      "under a bank overhanging the road. Upon the top of the bank was a low\n",
      "brick wall, surmounted by an iron railing. In the shadow of bank and\n",
      "wall the three turned out of the road, and up a blind lane, of which\n",
      "the wall--there, risen to some eight or ten feet high--formed one side.\n",
      "Crouching down in a corner, peeping up the lane, the next object that\n",
      "Young Jerry saw, was the form of his honoured parent, pretty well\n",
      "defined against a watery and clouded moon, nimbly scaling an iron gate.\n",
      "He was soon over, and then the second fisherman got over, and then the\n",
      "third. They all dropped softly on the ground within the gate, and lay\n",
      "there a little--listening perhaps. Then, they moved away on their hands\n",
      "and knees.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was now Young Jerry’s turn to approach the gate: which he did,\n",
      "holding his breath. Crouching down again in a corner there, and looking\n",
      "in, he made out the three fishermen creeping through some rank grass!\n",
      "and all the gravestones in the churchyard--it was a large churchyard\n",
      "that they were in--looking on like ghosts in white, while the church\n",
      "tower itself looked on like the ghost of a monstrous giant. They did not\n",
      "creep far, before they stopped and stood upright. And then they began to\n",
      "fish.\n",
      "\n",
      "They fished with a spade, at first. Presently the honoured parent\n",
      "appeared to be adjusting some instrument like a great corkscrew.\n",
      "Whatever tools they worked with, they worked hard, until the awful\n",
      "striking of the church clock so terrified Young Jerry, that he made off,\n",
      "with his hair as stiff as his father’s.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, his long-cherished desire to know more about these matters, not\n",
      "only stopped him in his running away, but lured him back again. They\n",
      "were still fishing perseveringly, when he peeped in at the gate for\n",
      "the second time; but, now they seemed to have got a bite. There was a\n",
      "screwing and complaining sound down below, and their bent figures were\n",
      "strained, as if by a weight. By slow degrees the weight broke away the\n",
      "earth upon it, and came to the surface. Young Jerry very well knew what\n",
      "it would be; but, when he saw it, and saw his honoured parent about to\n",
      "wrench it open, he was so frightened, being new to the sight, that he\n",
      "made off again, and never stopped until he had run a mile or more.\n",
      "\n",
      "He would not have stopped then, for anything less necessary than breath,\n",
      "it being a spectral sort of race that he ran, and one highly desirable\n",
      "to get to the end of. He had a strong idea that the coffin he had seen\n",
      "was running after him; and, pictured as hopping on behind him, bolt\n",
      "upright, upon its narrow end, always on the point of overtaking him\n",
      "and hopping on at his side--perhaps taking his arm--it was a pursuer to\n",
      "shun. It was an inconsistent and ubiquitous fiend too, for, while it\n",
      "was making the whole night behind him dreadful, he darted out into the\n",
      "roadway to avoid dark alleys, fearful of its coming hopping out of them\n",
      "like a dropsical boy’s kite without tail and wings. It hid in doorways\n",
      "too, rubbing its horrible shoulders against doors, and drawing them up\n",
      "to its ears, as if it were laughing. It got into shadows on the road,\n",
      "and lay cunningly on its back to trip him up. All this time it was\n",
      "incessantly hopping on behind and gaining on him, so that when the boy\n",
      "got to his own door he had reason for being half dead. And even then\n",
      "it would not leave him, but followed him upstairs with a bump on every\n",
      "stair, scrambled into bed with him, and bumped down, dead and heavy, on\n",
      "his breast when he fell asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "From his oppressed slumber, Young Jerry in his closet was awakened after\n",
      "daybreak and before sunrise, by the presence of his father in the\n",
      "family room. Something had gone wrong with him; at least, so Young Jerry\n",
      "inferred, from the circumstance of his holding Mrs. Cruncher by the\n",
      "ears, and knocking the back of her head against the head-board of the\n",
      "bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I told you I would,” said Mr. Cruncher, “and I did.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jerry, Jerry, Jerry!” his wife implored.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You oppose yourself to the profit of the business,” said Jerry, “and me\n",

      "you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I try to be a good wife, Jerry,” the poor woman protested, with tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is it being a good wife to oppose your husband’s business? Is it\n",
      "honouring your husband to dishonour his business? Is it obeying your\n",
      "husband to disobey him on the wital subject of his business?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You hadn’t taken to the dreadful business then, Jerry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s enough for you,” retorted Mr. Cruncher, “to be the wife of a\n",
      "honest tradesman, and not to occupy your female mind with calculations\n",
      "when he took to his trade or when he didn’t. A honouring and obeying\n",
      "wife would let his trade alone altogether. Call yourself a religious\n",
      "woman? If you’re a religious woman, give me a irreligious one! You have\n",
      "no more nat’ral sense of duty than the bed of this here Thames river has\n",
      "of a pile, and similarly it must be knocked into you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The altercation was conducted in a low tone of voice, and terminated in\n",
      "the honest tradesman’s kicking off his clay-soiled boots, and lying down\n",
      "at his length on the floor. After taking a timid peep at him lying on\n",
      "his back, with his rusty hands under his head for a pillow, his son lay\n",
      "down too, and fell asleep again.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no fish for breakfast, and not much of anything else. Mr.\n",
      "Cruncher was out of spirits, and out of temper, and kept an iron pot-lid\n",
      "by him as a projectile for the correction of Mrs. Cruncher, in case\n",
      "he should observe any symptoms of her saying Grace. He was brushed\n",
      "and washed at the usual hour, and set off with his son to pursue his\n",
      "ostensible calling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Young Jerry, walking with the stool under his arm at his father’s side\n",
      "along sunny and crowded Fleet-street, was a very different Young Jerry\n",
      "from him of the previous night, running home through darkness and\n",
      "solitude from his grim pursuer. His cunning was fresh with the day,\n",
      "and his qualms were gone with the night--in which particulars it is not\n",
      "improbable that he had compeers in Fleet-street and the City of London,\n",
      "that fine morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Father,” said Young Jerry, as they walked along: taking care to keep\n",
      "at arm’s length and to have the stool well between them: “what’s a\n",
      "Resurrection-Man?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Cruncher came to a stop on the pavement before he answered, “How\n",
      "should I know?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thought you knowed everything, father,” said the artless boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hem! Well,” returned Mr. Cruncher, going on again, and lifting off his\n",
      "hat to give his spikes free play, “he’s a tradesman.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What’s his goods, father?” asked the brisk Young Jerry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“His goods,” said Mr. Cruncher, after turning it over in his mind, “is a\n",
      "branch of Scientific goods.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Persons’ bodies, ain’t it, father?” asked the lively boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I believe it is something of that sort,” said Mr. Cruncher.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, father, I should so like to be a Resurrection-Man when I’m quite\n",
      "growed up!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Cruncher was soothed, but shook his head in a dubious and moral way.\n",
      "“It depends upon how you dewelop your talents. Be careful to dewelop\n",
      "your talents, and never to say no more than you can help to nobody, and\n",
      "there’s no telling at the present time what you may not come to be fit\n",
      "for.” As Young Jerry, thus encouraged, went on a few yards in advance,\n",
      "to plant the stool in the shadow of the Bar, Mr. Cruncher added to\n",
      "himself: “Jerry, you honest tradesman, there’s hopes wot that boy will\n",
      "yet be a blessing to you, and a recompense to you for his mother!”\n",

      "There had been earlier drinking than usual in the wine-shop of Monsieur\n",
      "Defarge. As early as six o’clock in the morning, sallow faces peeping\n",
      "through its barred windows had descried other faces within, bending over\n",
      "measures of wine. Monsieur Defarge sold a very thin wine at the best\n",
      "of times, but it would seem to have been an unusually thin wine that\n",
      "he sold at this time. A sour wine, moreover, or a souring, for its\n",
      "influence on the mood of those who drank it was to make them gloomy. No\n",
      "vivacious Bacchanalian flame leaped out of the pressed grape of Monsieur\n",
      "Defarge: but, a smouldering fire that burnt in the dark, lay hidden in\n",
      "the dregs of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "This had been the third morning in succession, on which there had been\n",
      "early drinking at the wine-shop of Monsieur Defarge. It had begun\n",
      "on Monday, and here was Wednesday come. There had been more of early\n",
      "brooding than drinking; for, many men had listened and whispered and\n",
      "slunk about there from the time of the opening of the door, who could\n",
      "not have laid a piece of money on the counter to save their souls. These\n",
      "were to the full as interested in the place, however, as if they could\n",
      "have commanded whole barrels of wine; and they glided from seat to seat,\n",
      "and from corner to corner, swallowing talk in lieu of drink, with greedy\n",
      "looks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notwithstanding an unusual flow of company, the master of the wine-shop\n",
      "was not visible. He was not missed; for, nobody who crossed the\n",
      "threshold looked for him, nobody asked for him, nobody wondered to see\n",
      "only Madame Defarge in her seat, presiding over the distribution of\n",
      "wine, with a bowl of battered small coins before her, as much defaced\n",
      "and beaten out of their original impress as the small coinage of\n",
      "humanity from whose ragged pockets they had come.\n",
      "\n",
      "A suspended interest and a prevalent absence of mind, were perhaps\n",
      "observed by the spies who looked in at the wine-shop, as they looked in\n",
      "at every place, high and low, from the king’s palace to the criminal’s\n",
      "gaol. Games at cards languished, players at dominoes musingly built\n",
      "towers with them, drinkers drew figures on the tables with spilt drops\n",
      "of wine, Madame Defarge herself picked out the pattern on her sleeve\n",
      "with her toothpick, and saw and heard something inaudible and invisible\n",
      "a long way off.\n",

      "Thus, Saint Antoine in this vinous feature of his, until midday. It was\n",
      "high noontide, when two dusty men passed through his streets and under\n",
      "his swinging lamps: of whom, one was Monsieur Defarge: the other a\n",
      "mender of roads in a blue cap. All adust and athirst, the two entered\n",
      "the wine-shop. Their arrival had lighted a kind of fire in the breast\n",
      "of Saint Antoine, fast spreading as they came along, which stirred and\n",
      "flickered in flames of faces at most doors and windows. Yet, no one had\n",
      "followed them, and no man spoke when they entered the wine-shop, though\n",
      "the eyes of every man there were turned upon them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good day, gentlemen!” said Monsieur Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "It may have been a signal for loosening the general tongue. It elicited\n",
      "an answering chorus of “Good day!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is bad weather, gentlemen,” said Defarge, shaking his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon which, every man looked at his neighbour, and then all cast down\n",
      "their eyes and sat silent. Except one man, who got up and went out.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My wife,” said Defarge aloud, addressing Madame Defarge: “I have\n",
      "travelled certain leagues with this good mender of roads, called\n",
      "Jacques. I met him--by accident--a day and half’s journey out of Paris.\n",

      "\n",
      "A second man got up and went out. Madame Defarge set wine before the\n",
      "mender of roads called Jacques, who doffed his blue cap to the company,\n",
      "and drank. In the breast of his blouse he carried some coarse dark\n",
      "bread; he ate of this between whiles, and sat munching and drinking near\n",
      "Madame Defarge’s counter. A third man got up and went out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Defarge refreshed himself with a draught of wine--but, he took less\n",
      "than was given to the stranger, as being himself a man to whom it was no\n",
      "rarity--and stood waiting until the countryman had made his breakfast.\n",
      "He looked at no one present, and no one now looked at him; not even\n",
      "Madame Defarge, who had taken up her knitting, and was at work.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you finished your repast, friend?” he asked, in due season.\n",

      "“Yes, thank you.”\n",

      "\n",
      "Out of the wine-shop into the street, out of the street into a\n",
      "courtyard, out of the courtyard up a steep staircase, out of the\n",
      "staircase into a garret--formerly the garret where a white-haired man\n",
      "sat on a low bench, stooping forward and very busy, making shoes.\n",
      "\n",
      "No white-haired man was there now; but, the three men were there who had\n",
      "gone out of the wine-shop singly. And between them and the white-haired\n",
      "man afar off, was the one small link, that they had once looked in at\n",
      "him through the chinks in the wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "Defarge closed the door carefully, and spoke in a subdued voice:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques Three! This is the witness\n",
      "encountered by appointment, by me, Jacques Four. He will tell you all.\n",
      "Speak, Jacques Five!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The mender of roads, blue cap in hand, wiped his swarthy forehead with\n",
      "it, and said, “Where shall I commence, monsieur?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Commence,” was Monsieur Defarge’s not unreasonable reply, “at the\n",
      "commencement.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I saw him then, messieurs,” began the mender of roads, “a year ago this\n",
      "running summer, underneath the carriage of the Marquis, hanging by the\n",
      "chain. Behold the manner of it. I leaving my work on the road, the sun\n",
      "going to bed, the carriage of the Marquis slowly ascending the hill, he\n",
      "hanging by the chain--like this.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Again the mender of roads went through the whole performance; in which\n",
      "he ought to have been perfect by that time, seeing that it had been\n",
      "the infallible resource and indispensable entertainment of his village\n",
      "during a whole year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jacques One struck in, and asked if he had ever seen the man before?\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never,” answered the mender of roads, recovering his perpendicular.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jacques Three demanded how he afterwards recognised him then?\n",
      "\n",
      "“By his tall figure,” said the mender of roads, softly, and with his\n",
      "finger at his nose. “When Monsieur the Marquis demands that evening,\n",
      "‘Say, what is he like?’ I make response, ‘Tall as a spectre.’”\n",

      "“But what did I know? The deed was not then accomplished, neither did he\n",
      "confide in me. Observe! Under those circumstances even, I do not\n",

      "My faith, messieurs, I offer nothing.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“No matter, the number,” said Defarge. “He is well hidden, but at last\n",
      "he is unluckily found. Go on!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am again at work upon the hill-side, and the sun is again about to\n",
      "go to bed. I am collecting my tools to descend to my cottage down in the\n",
      "village below, where it is already dark, when I raise my eyes, and see\n",
      "coming over the hill six soldiers. In the midst of them is a tall man\n",
      "with his arms bound--tied to his sides--like this!”\n",
      "\n",
      "With the aid of his indispensable cap, he represented a man with his\n",

      "\n",
      "“I stand aside, messieurs, by my heap of stones, to see the soldiers\n",
      "and their prisoner pass (for it is a solitary road, that, where any\n",
      "spectacle is well worth looking at), and at first, as they approach, I\n",
      "see no more than that they are six soldiers with a tall man bound, and\n",
      "that they are almost black to my sight--except on the side of the sun\n",
      "going to bed, where they have a red edge, messieurs. Also, I see that\n",
      "their long shadows are on the hollow ridge on the opposite side of the\n",
      "road, and are on the hill above it, and are like the shadows of giants.\n",
      "Also, I see that they are covered with dust, and that the dust moves\n",
      "with them as they come, tramp, tramp! But when they advance quite near\n",
      "to me, I recognise the tall man, and he recognises me. Ah, but he would\n",
      "be well content to precipitate himself over the hill-side once again, as\n",
      "on the evening when he and I first encountered, close to the same spot!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He described it as if he were there, and it was evident that he saw it\n",
      "vividly; perhaps he had not seen much in his life.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not show the soldiers that I recognise the tall man; he does not\n",
      "show the soldiers that he recognises me; we do it, and we know it, with\n",
      "our eyes. ‘Come on!’ says the chief of that company, pointing to the\n",
      "village, ‘bring him fast to his tomb!’ and they bring him faster. I\n",
      "follow. His arms are swelled because of being bound so tight, his wooden\n",
      "shoes are large and clumsy, and he is lame. Because he is lame, and\n",
      "consequently slow, they drive him with their guns--like this!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He imitated the action of a man’s being impelled forward by the\n",
      "butt-ends of muskets.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As they descend the hill like madmen running a race, he falls. They\n",
      "laugh and pick him up again. His face is bleeding and covered with dust,\n",
      "but he cannot touch it; thereupon they laugh again. They bring him into\n",
      "the village; all the village runs to look; they take him past the mill,\n",
      "and up to the prison; all the village sees the prison gate open in the\n",
      "darkness of the night, and swallow him--like this!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He opened his mouth as wide as he could, and shut it with a sounding\n",
      "snap of his teeth. Observant of his unwillingness to mar the effect by\n",
      "opening it again, Defarge said, “Go on, Jacques.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“All the village,” pursued the mender of roads, on tiptoe and in a low\n",
      "voice, “withdraws; all the village whispers by the fountain; all the\n",
      "village sleeps; all the village dreams of that unhappy one, within the\n",
      "locks and bars of the prison on the crag, and never to come out of it,\n",
      "except to perish. In the morning, with my tools upon my shoulder, eating\n",
      "my morsel of black bread as I go, I make a circuit by the prison, on\n",
      "my way to my work. There I see him, high up, behind the bars of a lofty\n",
      "iron cage, bloody and dusty as last night, looking through. He has no\n",

      "dead man.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Defarge and the three glanced darkly at one another. The looks of all\n",
      "of them were dark, repressed, and revengeful, as they listened to the\n",
      "countryman’s story; the manner of all of them, while it was secret, was\n",
      "authoritative too. They had the air of a rough tribunal; Jacques One\n",
      "and Two sitting on the old pallet-bed, each with his chin resting on\n",
      "his hand, and his eyes intent on the road-mender; Jacques Three, equally\n",
      "intent, on one knee behind them, with his agitated hand always gliding\n",
      "over the network of fine nerves about his mouth and nose; Defarge\n",
      "standing between them and the narrator, whom he had stationed in the\n",
      "light of the window, by turns looking from him to them, and from them to\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Go on, Jacques,” said Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He remains up there in his iron cage some days. The village looks\n",
      "at him by stealth, for it is afraid. But it always looks up, from a\n",
      "distance, at the prison on the crag; and in the evening, when the work\n",
      "of the day is achieved and it assembles to gossip at the fountain, all\n",
      "faces are turned towards the prison. Formerly, they were turned towards\n",
      "the posting-house; now, they are turned towards the prison. They\n",
      "whisper at the fountain, that although condemned to death he will not be\n",
      "executed; they say that petitions have been presented in Paris, showing\n",
      "that he was enraged and made mad by the death of his child; they say\n",
      "that a petition has been presented to the King himself. What do I know?\n",
      "It is possible. Perhaps yes, perhaps no.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Listen then, Jacques,” Number One of that name sternly interposed.\n",
      "“Know that a petition was presented to the King and Queen. All here,\n",
      "yourself excepted, saw the King take it, in his carriage in the street,\n",
      "sitting beside the Queen. It is Defarge whom you see here, who, at the\n",
      "hazard of his life, darted out before the horses, with the petition in\n",
      "his hand.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And once again listen, Jacques!” said the kneeling Number Three:\n",
      "his fingers ever wandering over and over those fine nerves, with a\n",
      "strikingly greedy air, as if he hungered for something--that was neither\n",
      "food nor drink; “the guard, horse and foot, surrounded the petitioner,\n",
      "and struck him blows. You hear?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hear, messieurs.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Go on then,” said Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Again; on the other hand, they whisper at the fountain,” resumed the\n",
      "countryman, “that he is brought down into our country to be executed on\n",
      "the spot, and that he will very certainly be executed. They even whisper\n",
      "that because he has slain Monseigneur, and because Monseigneur was the\n",
      "father of his tenants--serfs--what you will--he will be executed as a\n",
      "parricide. One old man says at the fountain, that his right hand, armed\n",
      "with the knife, will be burnt off before his face; that, into wounds\n",
      "which will be made in his arms, his breast, and his legs, there will be\n",
      "poured boiling oil, melted lead, hot resin, wax, and sulphur; finally,\n",
      "that he will be torn limb from limb by four strong horses. That old man\n",
      "says, all this was actually done to a prisoner who made an attempt on\n",
      "the life of the late King, Louis Fifteen. But how do I know if he lies?\n",
      "I am not a scholar.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Listen once again then, Jacques!” said the man with the restless hand\n",
      "and the craving air. “The name of that prisoner was Damiens, and it was\n",
      "all done in open day, in the open streets of this city of Paris; and\n",
      "nothing was more noticed in the vast concourse that saw it done, than\n",
      "the crowd of ladies of quality and fashion, who were full of eager\n",
      "attention to the last--to the last, Jacques, prolonged until nightfall,\n",
      "when he had lost two legs and an arm, and still breathed! And it was\n",
      "done--why, how old are you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thirty-five,” said the mender of roads, who looked sixty.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was done when you were more than ten years old; you might have seen\n",
      "it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Enough!” said Defarge, with grim impatience. “Long live the Devil! Go\n",
      "on.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well! Some whisper this, some whisper that; they speak of nothing else;\n",
      "even the fountain appears to fall to that tune. At length, on Sunday\n",
      "night when all the village is asleep, come soldiers, winding down from\n",
      "the prison, and their guns ring on the stones of the little street.\n",
      "Workmen dig, workmen hammer, soldiers laugh and sing; in the morning, by\n",
      "the fountain, there is raised a gallows forty feet high, poisoning the\n",
      "water.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The mender of roads looked _through_ rather than _at_ the low ceiling,\n",
      "and pointed as if he saw the gallows somewhere in the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "“All work is stopped, all assemble there, nobody leads the cows out,\n",
      "the cows are there with the rest. At midday, the roll of drums. Soldiers\n",
      "have marched into the prison in the night, and he is in the midst\n",
      "of many soldiers. He is bound as before, and in his mouth there is\n",
      "a gag--tied so, with a tight string, making him look almost as if he\n",
      "laughed.” He suggested it, by creasing his face with his two thumbs,\n",
      "from the corners of his mouth to his ears. “On the top of the gallows is\n",
      "fixed the knife, blade upwards, with its point in the air. He is hanged\n",
      "there forty feet high--and is left hanging, poisoning the water.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They looked at one another, as he used his blue cap to wipe his face,\n",
      "on which the perspiration had started afresh while he recalled the\n",
      "spectacle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is frightful, messieurs. How can the women and the children draw\n",
      "water! Who can gossip of an evening, under that shadow! Under it, have\n",
      "I said? When I left the village, Monday evening as the sun was going to\n",
      "bed, and looked back from the hill, the shadow struck across the church,\n",
      "across the mill, across the prison--seemed to strike across the earth,\n",
      "messieurs, to where the sky rests upon it!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The hungry man gnawed one of his fingers as he looked at the other\n",
      "three, and his finger quivered with the craving that was on him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s all, messieurs. I left at sunset (as I had been warned to do),\n",
      "and I walked on, that night and half next day, until I met (as I was\n",
      "warned I should) this comrade. With him, I came on, now riding and now\n",
      "walking, through the rest of yesterday and through last night. And here\n",
      "you see me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "After a gloomy silence, the first Jacques said, “Good! You have acted\n",
      "and recounted faithfully. Will you wait for us a little, outside the\n",
      "door?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very willingly,” said the mender of roads. Whom Defarge escorted to the\n",
      "top of the stairs, and, leaving seated there, returned.\n",
      "\n",
      "The three had risen, and their heads were together when he came back to\n",
      "the garret.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How say you, Jacques?” demanded Number One. “To be registered?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To be registered, as doomed to destruction,” returned Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Magnificent!” croaked the man with the craving.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The chateau, and all the race?” inquired the first.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The chateau and all the race,” returned Defarge. “Extermination.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The hungry man repeated, in a rapturous croak, “Magnificent!” and began\n",
      "gnawing another finger.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you sure,” asked Jacques Two, of Defarge, “that no embarrassment\n",
      "can arise from our manner of keeping the register? Without doubt it is\n",
      "safe, for no one beyond ourselves can decipher it; but shall we always\n",
      "be able to decipher it--or, I ought to say, will she?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jacques,” returned Defarge, drawing himself up, “if madame my wife\n",
      "undertook to keep the register in her memory alone, she would not lose\n",
      "a word of it--not a syllable of it. Knitted, in her own stitches and her\n",
      "own symbols, it will always be as plain to her as the sun. Confide in\n",
      "Madame Defarge. It would be easier for the weakest poltroon that lives,\n",
      "to erase himself from existence, than to erase one letter of his name or\n",
      "crimes from the knitted register of Madame Defarge.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a murmur of confidence and approval, and then the man who\n",
      "hungered, asked: “Is this rustic to be sent back soon? I hope so. He is\n",
      "very simple; is he not a little dangerous?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He knows nothing,” said Defarge; “at least nothing more than would\n",
      "easily elevate himself to a gallows of the same height. I charge myself\n",
      "with him; let him remain with me; I will take care of him, and set him\n",
      "on his road. He wishes to see the fine world--the King, the Queen, and\n",
      "Court; let him see them on Sunday.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What?” exclaimed the hungry man, staring. “Is it a good sign, that he\n",
      "wishes to see Royalty and Nobility?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jacques,” said Defarge; “judiciously show a cat milk, if you wish her\n",
      "to thirst for it. Judiciously show a dog his natural prey, if you wish\n",
      "him to bring it down one day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing more was said, and the mender of roads, being found already\n",
      "dozing on the topmost stair, was advised to lay himself down on the\n",
      "pallet-bed and take some rest. He needed no persuasion, and was soon\n",
      "asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "Worse quarters than Defarge’s wine-shop, could easily have been found\n",
      "in Paris for a provincial slave of that degree. Saving for a mysterious\n",
      "dread of madame by which he was constantly haunted, his life was very\n",
      "new and agreeable. But, madame sat all day at her counter, so expressly\n",
      "unconscious of him, and so particularly determined not to perceive that\n",
      "his being there had any connection with anything below the surface, that\n",
      "he shook in his wooden shoes whenever his eye lighted on her. For, he\n",
      "contended with himself that it was impossible to foresee what that lady\n",
      "might pretend next; and he felt assured that if she should take it\n",
      "into her brightly ornamented head to pretend that she had seen him do a\n",
      "murder and afterwards flay the victim, she would infallibly go through\n",
      "with it until the play was played out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, when Sunday came, the mender of roads was not enchanted\n",
      "(though he said he was) to find that madame was to accompany monsieur\n",
      "and himself to Versailles. It was additionally disconcerting to have\n",
      "madame knitting all the way there, in a public conveyance; it was\n",
      "additionally disconcerting yet, to have madame in the crowd in the\n",
      "afternoon, still with her knitting in her hands as the crowd waited to\n",
      "see the carriage of the King and Queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You work hard, madame,” said a man near her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” answered Madame Defarge; “I have a good deal to do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you make, madame?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Many things.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“For instance--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“For instance,” returned Madame Defarge, composedly, “shrouds.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The man moved a little further away, as soon as he could, and the mender\n",
      "of roads fanned himself with his blue cap: feeling it mightily close\n",
      "and oppressive. If he needed a King and Queen to restore him, he was\n",
      "fortunate in having his remedy at hand; for, soon the large-faced King\n",
      "and the fair-faced Queen came in their golden coach, attended by the\n",
      "shining Bull’s Eye of their Court, a glittering multitude of laughing\n",
      "ladies and fine lords; and in jewels and silks and powder and splendour\n",
      "and elegantly spurning figures and handsomely disdainful faces of both\n",
      "sexes, the mender of roads bathed himself, so much to his temporary\n",
      "intoxication, that he cried Long live the King, Long live the Queen,\n",
      "Long live everybody and everything! as if he had never heard of\n",
      "ubiquitous Jacques in his time. Then, there were gardens, courtyards,\n",
      "terraces, fountains, green banks, more King and Queen, more Bull’s Eye,\n",
      "more lords and ladies, more Long live they all! until he absolutely wept\n",
      "with sentiment. During the whole of this scene, which lasted some three\n",
      "hours, he had plenty of shouting and weeping and sentimental company,\n",
      "and throughout Defarge held him by the collar, as if to restrain him\n",
      "from flying at the objects of his brief devotion and tearing them to\n",
      "pieces.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bravo!” said Defarge, clapping him on the back when it was over, like a\n",
      "patron; “you are a good boy!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The mender of roads was now coming to himself, and was mistrustful of\n",
      "having made a mistake in his late demonstrations; but no.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are the fellow we want,” said Defarge, in his ear; “you make\n",
      "these fools believe that it will last for ever. Then, they are the more\n",
      "insolent, and it is the nearer ended.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hey!” cried the mender of roads, reflectively; “that’s true.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“These fools know nothing. While they despise your breath, and would\n",
      "stop it for ever and ever, in you or in a hundred like you rather than\n",
      "in one of their own horses or dogs, they only know what your breath\n",
      "tells them. Let it deceive them, then, a little longer; it cannot\n",
      "deceive them too much.”\n",

      "stick to burn, strayed within sight of the great stone courtyard and\n",

      "world, with all its greatnesses and littlenesses, lie in a twinkling\n",
      "star. And as mere human knowledge can split a ray of light and analyse\n",
      "the manner of its composition, so, sublimer intelligences may read in\n",
      "the feeble shining of this earth of ours, every thought and act, every\n",

      "The Defarges, husband and wife, came lumbering under the starlight,\n",
      "in their public vehicle, to that gate of Paris whereunto their\n",
      "journey naturally tended. There was the usual stoppage at the barrier\n",
      "guardhouse, and the usual lanterns came glancing forth for the usual\n",
      "examination and inquiry. Monsieur Defarge alighted; knowing one or two\n",
      "of the soldiery there, and one of the police. The latter he was intimate\n",
      "with, and affectionately embraced.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Saint Antoine had again enfolded the Defarges in his dusky wings,\n",
      "and they, having finally alighted near the Saint’s boundaries, were\n",
      "picking their way on foot through the black mud and offal of his\n",
      "streets, Madame Defarge spoke to her husband:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Say then, my friend; what did Jacques of the police tell thee?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very little to-night, but all he knows. There is another spy\n",
      "commissioned for our quarter. There may be many more, for all that he\n",
      "can say, but he knows of one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Eh well!” said Madame Defarge, raising her eyebrows with a cool\n",
      "business air. “It is necessary to register him. How do they call that\n",
      "man?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He is English.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So much the better. His name?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Barsad,” said Defarge, making it French by pronunciation. But, he had\n",
      "been so careful to get it accurately, that he then spelt it with perfect\n",
      "correctness.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Barsad,” repeated madame. “Good. Christian name?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“John.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“John Barsad,” repeated madame, after murmuring it once to herself.\n",
      "“Good. His appearance; is it known?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Age, about forty years; height, about five feet nine; black hair;\n",
      "complexion dark; generally, rather handsome visage; eyes dark, face\n",
      "thin, long, and sallow; nose aquiline, but not straight, having a\n",
      "peculiar inclination towards the left cheek; expression, therefore,\n",
      "sinister.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Eh my faith. It is a portrait!” said madame, laughing. “He shall be\n",
      "registered to-morrow.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They turned into the wine-shop, which was closed (for it was midnight),\n",
      "and where Madame Defarge immediately took her post at her desk, counted\n",
      "the small moneys that had been taken during her absence, examined the\n",
      "stock, went through the entries in the book, made other entries of\n",
      "her own, checked the serving man in every possible way, and finally\n",
      "dismissed him to bed. Then she turned out the contents of the bowl\n",
      "of money for the second time, and began knotting them up in her\n",
      "handkerchief, in a chain of separate knots, for safe keeping through the\n",
      "night. All this while, Defarge, with his pipe in his mouth, walked\n",
      "up and down, complacently admiring, but never interfering; in which\n",
      "condition, indeed, as to the business and his domestic affairs, he\n",
      "walked up and down through life.\n",
      "\n",
      "The night was hot, and the shop, close shut and surrounded by so foul a\n",
      "neighbourhood, was ill-smelling. Monsieur Defarge’s olfactory sense was\n",
      "by no means delicate, but the stock of wine smelt much stronger than\n",
      "it ever tasted, and so did the stock of rum and brandy and aniseed. He\n",
      "whiffed the compound of scents away, as he put down his smoked-out pipe.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are fatigued,” said madame, raising her glance as she knotted the\n",
      "money. “There are only the usual odours.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am a little tired,” her husband acknowledged.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are a little depressed, too,” said madame, whose quick eyes had\n",
      "never been so intent on the accounts, but they had had a ray or two for\n",
      "him. “Oh, the men, the men!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But my dear!” began Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But my dear!” repeated madame, nodding firmly; “but my dear! You are\n",
      "faint of heart to-night, my dear!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, then,” said Defarge, as if a thought were wrung out of his\n",
      "breast, “it _is_ a long time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is a long time,” repeated his wife; “and when is it not a long time?\n",
      "Vengeance and retribution require a long time; it is the rule.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It does not take a long time to strike a man with Lightning,” said\n",
      "Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How long,” demanded madame, composedly, “does it take to make and store\n",
      "the lightning? Tell me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Defarge raised his head thoughtfully, as if there were something in that\n",
      "too.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It does not take a long time,” said madame, “for an earthquake to\n",
      "swallow a town. Eh well! Tell me how long it takes to prepare the\n",
      "earthquake?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A long time, I suppose,” said Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But when it is ready, it takes place, and grinds to pieces everything\n",
      "before it. In the meantime, it is always preparing, though it is not\n",
      "seen or heard. That is your consolation. Keep it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She tied a knot with flashing eyes, as if it throttled a foe.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I tell thee,” said madame, extending her right hand, for emphasis,\n",
      "“that although it is a long time on the road, it is on the road and\n",
      "coming. I tell thee it never retreats, and never stops. I tell thee it\n",
      "is always advancing. Look around and consider the lives of all the world\n",
      "that we know, consider the faces of all the world that we know, consider\n",
      "the rage and discontent to which the Jacquerie addresses itself with\n",
      "more and more of certainty every hour. Can such things last? Bah! I mock\n",
      "you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My brave wife,” returned Defarge, standing before her with his head\n",
      "a little bent, and his hands clasped at his back, like a docile and\n",
      "attentive pupil before his catechist, “I do not question all this. But\n",
      "it has lasted a long time, and it is possible--you know well, my wife,\n",
      "it is possible--that it may not come, during our lives.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Eh well! How then?” demanded madame, tying another knot, as if there\n",
      "were another enemy strangled.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well!” said Defarge, with a half complaining and half apologetic shrug.\n",
      "“We shall not see the triumph.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We shall have helped it,” returned madame, with her extended hand in\n",
      "strong action. “Nothing that we do, is done in vain. I believe, with all\n",
      "my soul, that we shall see the triumph. But even if not, even if I knew\n",
      "certainly not, show me the neck of an aristocrat and tyrant, and still I\n",
      "would--”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then madame, with her teeth set, tied a very terrible knot indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hold!” cried Defarge, reddening a little as if he felt charged with\n",
      "cowardice; “I too, my dear, will stop at nothing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes! But it is your weakness that you sometimes need to see your victim\n",
      "and your opportunity, to sustain you. Sustain yourself without that.\n",
      "When the time comes, let loose a tiger and a devil; but wait for the\n",
      "time with the tiger and the devil chained--not shown--yet always ready.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame enforced the conclusion of this piece of advice by striking her\n",
      "little counter with her chain of money as if she knocked its brains\n",
      "out, and then gathering the heavy handkerchief under her arm in a serene\n",
      "manner, and observing that it was time to go to bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next noontide saw the admirable woman in her usual place in the\n",
      "wine-shop, knitting away assiduously. A rose lay beside her, and if she\n",
      "now and then glanced at the flower, it was with no infraction of her\n",
      "usual preoccupied air. There were a few customers, drinking or not\n",
      "drinking, standing or seated, sprinkled about. The day was very hot,\n",
      "and heaps of flies, who were extending their inquisitive and adventurous\n",
      "perquisitions into all the glutinous little glasses near madame, fell\n",
      "dead at the bottom. Their decease made no impression on the other flies\n",
      "out promenading, who looked at them in the coolest manner (as if they\n",
      "themselves were elephants, or something as far removed), until they met\n",
      "the same fate. Curious to consider how heedless flies are!--perhaps they\n",
      "thought as much at Court that sunny summer day.\n",
      "\n",
      "A figure entering at the door threw a shadow on Madame Defarge which she\n",
      "felt to be a new one. She laid down her knitting, and began to pin her\n",
      "rose in her head-dress, before she looked at the figure.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was curious. The moment Madame Defarge took up the rose, the\n",
      "customers ceased talking, and began gradually to drop out of the\n",
      "wine-shop.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good day, madame,” said the new-comer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good day, monsieur.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She said it aloud, but added to herself, as she resumed her knitting:\n",
      "“Hah! Good day, age about forty, height about five feet nine, black\n",
      "hair, generally rather handsome visage, complexion dark, eyes dark,\n",
      "thin, long and sallow face, aquiline nose but not straight, having a\n",
      "peculiar inclination towards the left cheek which imparts a sinister\n",
      "expression! Good day, one and all!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have the goodness to give me a little glass of old cognac, and a\n",
      "mouthful of cool fresh water, madame.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame complied with a polite air.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Marvellous cognac this, madame!”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the first time it had ever been so complimented, and Madame\n",
      "Defarge knew enough of its antecedents to know better. She said,\n",
      "however, that the cognac was flattered, and took up her knitting. The\n",
      "visitor watched her fingers for a few moments, and took the opportunity\n",
      "of observing the place in general.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You knit with great skill, madame.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am accustomed to it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A pretty pattern too!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_You_ think so?” said madame, looking at him with a smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Decidedly. May one ask what it is for?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pastime,” said madame, still looking at him with a smile while her\n",
      "fingers moved nimbly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not for use?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That depends. I may find a use for it one day. If I do--Well,” said\n",
      "madame, drawing a breath and nodding her head with a stern kind of\n",
      "coquetry, “I’ll use it!”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was remarkable; but, the taste of Saint Antoine seemed to be\n",
      "decidedly opposed to a rose on the head-dress of Madame Defarge. Two\n",
      "men had entered separately, and had been about to order drink, when,\n",
      "catching sight of that novelty, they faltered, made a pretence of\n",
      "looking about as if for some friend who was not there, and went away.\n",
      "Nor, of those who had been there when this visitor entered, was there\n",
      "one left. They had all dropped off. The spy had kept his eyes open,\n",
      "but had been able to detect no sign. They had lounged away in a\n",
      "poverty-stricken, purposeless, accidental manner, quite natural and\n",
      "unimpeachable.\n",
      "\n",
      "“_John_,” thought madame, checking off her work as her fingers knitted,\n",
      "and her eyes looked at the stranger. “Stay long enough, and I shall knit\n",
      "‘BARSAD’ before you go.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have a husband, madame?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Children?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No children.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Business seems bad?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Business is very bad; the people are so poor.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, the unfortunate, miserable people! So oppressed, too--as you say.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“As _you_ say,” madame retorted, correcting him, and deftly knitting an\n",
      "extra something into his name that boded him no good.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pardon me; certainly it was I who said so, but you naturally think so.\n",
      "Of course.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_I_ think?” returned madame, in a high voice. “I and my husband have\n",
      "enough to do to keep this wine-shop open, without thinking. All we\n",
      "think, here, is how to live. That is the subject _we_ think of, and\n",
      "it gives us, from morning to night, enough to think about, without\n",
      "embarrassing our heads concerning others. _I_ think for others? No, no.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The spy, who was there to pick up any crumbs he could find or make, did\n",
      "not allow his baffled state to express itself in his sinister face; but,\n",
      "stood with an air of gossiping gallantry, leaning his elbow on Madame\n",
      "Defarge’s little counter, and occasionally sipping his cognac.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A bad business this, madame, of Gaspard’s execution. Ah! the poor\n",
      "Gaspard!” With a sigh of great compassion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My faith!” returned madame, coolly and lightly, “if people use knives\n",
      "for such purposes, they have to pay for it. He knew beforehand what the\n",
      "price of his luxury was; he has paid the price.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I believe,” said the spy, dropping his soft voice to a tone\n",
      "that invited confidence, and expressing an injured revolutionary\n",
      "susceptibility in every muscle of his wicked face: “I believe there\n",
      "is much compassion and anger in this neighbourhood, touching the poor\n",
      "fellow? Between ourselves.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is there?” asked madame, vacantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is there not?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“--Here is my husband!” said Madame Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the keeper of the wine-shop entered at the door, the spy saluted\n",
      "him by touching his hat, and saying, with an engaging smile, “Good day,\n",
      "Jacques!” Defarge stopped short, and stared at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good day, Jacques!” the spy repeated; with not quite so much\n",
      "confidence, or quite so easy a smile under the stare.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You deceive yourself, monsieur,” returned the keeper of the wine-shop.\n",
      "“You mistake me for another. That is not my name. I am Ernest Defarge.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is all the same,” said the spy, airily, but discomfited too: “good\n",
      "day!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good day!” answered Defarge, drily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was saying to madame, with whom I had the pleasure of chatting when\n",
      "you entered, that they tell me there is--and no wonder!--much sympathy\n",
      "and anger in Saint Antoine, touching the unhappy fate of poor Gaspard.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No one has told me so,” said Defarge, shaking his head. “I know nothing\n",
      "of it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Having said it, he passed behind the little counter, and stood with his\n",
      "hand on the back of his wife’s chair, looking over that barrier at the\n",
      "person to whom they were both opposed, and whom either of them would\n",
      "have shot with the greatest satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "The spy, well used to his business, did not change his unconscious\n",
      "attitude, but drained his little glass of cognac, took a sip of fresh\n",
      "water, and asked for another glass of cognac. Madame Defarge poured it\n",
      "out for him, took to her knitting again, and hummed a little song over\n",
      "it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You seem to know this quarter well; that is to say, better than I do?”\n",
      " observed Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not at all, but I hope to know it better. I am so profoundly interested\n",
      "in its miserable inhabitants.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hah!” muttered Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The pleasure of conversing with you, Monsieur Defarge, recalls to me,”\n",
      " pursued the spy, “that I have the honour of cherishing some interesting\n",
      "associations with your name.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed!” said Defarge, with much indifference.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, indeed. When Doctor Manette was released, you, his old domestic,\n",
      "had the charge of him, I know. He was delivered to you. You see I am\n",
      "informed of the circumstances?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Such is the fact, certainly,” said Defarge. He had had it conveyed\n",
      "to him, in an accidental touch of his wife’s elbow as she knitted and\n",
      "warbled, that he would do best to answer, but always with brevity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was to you,” said the spy, “that his daughter came; and it was\n",
      "from your care that his daughter took him, accompanied by a neat brown\n",
      "monsieur; how is he called?--in a little wig--Lorry--of the bank of\n",
      "Tellson and Company--over to England.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Such is the fact,” repeated Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very interesting remembrances!” said the spy. “I have known Doctor\n",
      "Manette and his daughter, in England.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes?” said Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You don’t hear much about them now?” said the spy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In effect,” madame struck in, looking up from her work and her little\n",
      "song, “we never hear about them. We received the news of their safe\n",
      "arrival, and perhaps another letter, or perhaps two; but, since then,\n",
      "they have gradually taken their road in life--we, ours--and we have held\n",
      "no correspondence.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perfectly so, madame,” replied the spy. “She is going to be married.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Going?” echoed madame. “She was pretty enough to have been married long\n",
      "ago. You English are cold, it seems to me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! You know I am English.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I perceive your tongue is,” returned madame; “and what the tongue is, I\n",
      "suppose the man is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not take the identification as a compliment; but he made the best\n",
      "of it, and turned it off with a laugh. After sipping his cognac to the\n",
      "end, he added:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, Miss Manette is going to be married. But not to an Englishman; to\n",
      "one who, like herself, is French by birth. And speaking of Gaspard (ah,\n",
      "poor Gaspard! It was cruel, cruel!), it is a curious thing that she is\n",
      "going to marry the nephew of Monsieur the Marquis, for whom Gaspard\n",
      "was exalted to that height of so many feet; in other words, the present\n",
      "Marquis. But he lives unknown in England, he is no Marquis there; he is\n",
      "Mr. Charles Darnay. D’Aulnais is the name of his mother’s family.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Defarge knitted steadily, but the intelligence had a palpable\n",
      "effect upon her husband. Do what he would, behind the little counter,\n",
      "as to the striking of a light and the lighting of his pipe, he was\n",
      "troubled, and his hand was not trustworthy. The spy would have been no\n",
      "spy if he had failed to see it, or to record it in his mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having made, at least, this one hit, whatever it might prove to be\n",
      "worth, and no customers coming in to help him to any other, Mr. Barsad\n",
      "paid for what he had drunk, and took his leave: taking occasion to say,\n",
      "in a genteel manner, before he departed, that he looked forward to the\n",
      "pleasure of seeing Monsieur and Madame Defarge again. For some minutes\n",
      "after he had emerged into the outer presence of Saint Antoine, the\n",
      "husband and wife remained exactly as he had left them, lest he should\n",
      "come back.\n",

      "was a son who would some day avenge his father. (There was a time in my\n",

      "me--rather, altogether ignorant of me, and unconscious of me. I have\n",
      "cast up the years of her age, year after year. I have seen her married\n",
      "to a man who knew nothing of my fate. I have altogether perished from\n",

      "foundations could--I have imagined her as coming to me in my cell, and\n",
      "leading me out into the freedom beyond the fortress. I have seen her\n",

      "and more real child. Of her outward appearance I know no more than\n",
      "that she was like her mother. The other had that likeness too--as you\n",
      "have--but was not the same. Can you follow me, Lucie? Hardly, I think?\n",

      "coming to me and taking me out to show me that the home of her married\n",
      "life was full of her loving remembrance of her lost father. My picture\n",
      "was in her room, and I was in her prayers. Her life was active,\n",
      "cheerful, useful; but my poor history pervaded it all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was that child, my father, I was not half so good, but in my love\n",
      "that was I.”\n",

      "a prison of the State, they kept far from its frowning walls, and looked\n",
      "up at its bars, and spoke in whispers. She could never deliver me; I\n",
      "imagined that she always brought me back after showing me such things.\n",
      "But then, blessed with the relief of tears, I fell upon my knees, and\n",
      "blessed her.”\n",

      "by taking to themselves the upper rooms formerly belonging to the\n",
      "apocryphal invisible lodger, and they desired nothing more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Doctor Manette was very cheerful at the little supper. They were only\n",

      "little plot that kept him away; and drank to him affectionately.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the time came for him to bid Lucie good night, and they separated.\n",

      "shadow at a distance, crept up to his bed, and put her lips to his;\n",
      "then, leaned over him, and looked at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Into his handsome face, the bitter waters of captivity had worn; but, he\n",
      "covered up their tracks with a determination so strong, that he held the\n",

      "resolute, and guarded struggle with an unseen assailant, was not to be\n",
      "beheld in all the wide dominions of sleep, that night.\n",

      "she might ever be as true to him as her love aspired to be, and as his\n",
      "sorrows deserved. Then, she withdrew her hand, and kissed his lips once\n",
      "more, and went away. So, the sunrise came, and the shadows of the leaves\n",

      "her waist, “I hear them moving in the next room, and Miss Pross and\n",

      "opportunity of saying something to you that you wish to hear. You leave\n",
      "your good father, my dear, in hands as earnest and as loving as your\n",

      "mingled with the poor shoemaker’s white locks in the Paris garret, were\n",
      "mingled with them again in the morning sunlight, on the threshold of the\n",
      "door at parting.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a hard parting, though it was not for long. But her father\n",
      "cheered her, and said at last, gently disengaging himself from her\n",
      "enfolding arms, “Take her, Charles! She is yours!”\n",
      "\n",
      "And her agitated hand waved to them from a chaise window, and she was\n",
      "gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The corner being out of the way of the idle and curious, and the\n",
      "preparations having been very simple and few, the Doctor, Mr. Lorry,\n",
      "and Miss Pross, were left quite alone. It was when they turned into\n",
      "the welcome shade of the cool old hall, that Mr. Lorry observed a great\n",
      "change to have come over the Doctor; as if the golden arm uplifted\n",
      "there, had struck him a poisoned blow.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had naturally repressed much, and some revulsion might have been\n",
      "expected in him when the occasion for repression was gone. But, it was\n",
      "the old scared lost look that troubled Mr. Lorry; and through his absent\n",
      "manner of clasping his head and drearily wandering away into his own\n",
      "room when they got up-stairs, Mr. Lorry was reminded of Defarge the\n",
      "wine-shop keeper, and the starlight ride.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think,” he whispered to Miss Pross, after anxious consideration, “I\n",
      "think we had best not speak to him just now, or at all disturb him.\n",
      "I must look in at Tellson’s; so I will go there at once and come back\n",
      "presently. Then, we will take him a ride into the country, and dine\n",
      "there, and all will be well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was easier for Mr. Lorry to look in at Tellson’s, than to look out of\n",
      "Tellson’s. He was detained two hours. When he came back, he ascended the\n",
      "old staircase alone, having asked no question of the servant; going thus\n",
      "into the Doctor’s rooms, he was stopped by a low sound of knocking.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good God!” he said, with a start. “What’s that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Pross, with a terrified face, was at his ear. “O me, O me! All is\n",
      "lost!” cried she, wringing her hands. “What is to be told to Ladybird?\n",
      "He doesn’t know me, and is making shoes!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lorry said what he could to calm her, and went himself into the\n",
      "Doctor’s room. The bench was turned towards the light, as it had been\n",
      "when he had seen the shoemaker at his work before, and his head was bent\n",
      "down, and he was very busy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Doctor Manette. My dear friend, Doctor Manette!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Doctor looked at him for a moment--half inquiringly, half as if he\n",
      "were angry at being spoken to--and bent over his work again.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had laid aside his coat and waistcoat; his shirt was open at the\n",
      "throat, as it used to be when he did that work; and even the old\n",
      "haggard, faded surface of face had come back to him. He worked\n",
      "hard--impatiently--as if in some sense of having been interrupted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lorry glanced at the work in his hand, and observed that it was a\n",
      "shoe of the old size and shape. He took up another that was lying by\n",
      "him, and asked what it was.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A young lady’s walking shoe,” he muttered, without looking up. “It\n",
      "ought to have been finished long ago. Let it be.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, Doctor Manette. Look at me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He obeyed, in the old mechanically submissive manner, without pausing in\n",
      "his work.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You know me, my dear friend? Think again. This is not your proper\n",
      "occupation. Think, dear friend!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing would induce him to speak more. He looked up, for an instant at\n",
      "a time, when he was requested to do so; but, no persuasion would extract\n",
      "a word from him. He worked, and worked, and worked, in silence, and\n",
      "words fell on him as they would have fallen on an echoless wall, or on\n",
      "the air. The only ray of hope that Mr. Lorry could discover, was, that\n",
      "he sometimes furtively looked up without being asked. In that, there\n",
      "seemed a faint expression of curiosity or perplexity--as though he were\n",
      "trying to reconcile some doubts in his mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two things at once impressed themselves on Mr. Lorry, as important above\n",
      "all others; the first, that this must be kept secret from Lucie;\n",
      "the second, that it must be kept secret from all who knew him. In\n",
      "conjunction with Miss Pross, he took immediate steps towards the latter\n",
      "precaution, by giving out that the Doctor was not well, and required a\n",
      "few days of complete rest. In aid of the kind deception to be practised\n",
      "on his daughter, Miss Pross was to write, describing his having been\n",
      "called away professionally, and referring to an imaginary letter of\n",
      "two or three hurried lines in his own hand, represented to have been\n",
      "addressed to her by the same post.\n",
      "\n",
      "These measures, advisable to be taken in any case, Mr. Lorry took in\n",
      "the hope of his coming to himself. If that should happen soon, he kept\n",
      "another course in reserve; which was, to have a certain opinion that he\n",
      "thought the best, on the Doctor’s case.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the hope of his recovery, and of resort to this third course\n",
      "being thereby rendered practicable, Mr. Lorry resolved to watch him\n",
      "attentively, with as little appearance as possible of doing so. He\n",
      "therefore made arrangements to absent himself from Tellson’s for the\n",
      "first time in his life, and took his post by the window in the same\n",
      "room.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was not long in discovering that it was worse than useless to speak\n",
      "to him, since, on being pressed, he became worried. He abandoned that\n",
      "attempt on the first day, and resolved merely to keep himself always\n",
      "before him, as a silent protest against the delusion into which he had\n",
      "fallen, or was falling. He remained, therefore, in his seat near the\n",
      "window, reading and writing, and expressing in as many pleasant and\n",
      "natural ways as he could think of, that it was a free place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Doctor Manette took what was given him to eat and drink, and worked on,\n",
      "that first day, until it was too dark to see--worked on, half an hour\n",
      "after Mr. Lorry could not have seen, for his life, to read or write.\n",
      "When he put his tools aside as useless, until morning, Mr. Lorry rose\n",
      "and said to him:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Will you go out?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked down at the floor on either side of him in the old manner,\n",
      "looked up in the old manner, and repeated in the old low voice:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Out?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes; for a walk with me. Why not?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He made no effort to say why not, and said not a word more. But, Mr.\n",
      "Lorry thought he saw, as he leaned forward on his bench in the dusk,\n",
      "with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands, that he was in\n",
      "some misty way asking himself, “Why not?” The sagacity of the man of\n",
      "business perceived an advantage here, and determined to hold it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Pross and he divided the night into two watches, and observed him\n",
      "at intervals from the adjoining room. He paced up and down for a long\n",
      "time before he lay down; but, when he did finally lay himself down, he\n",
      "fell asleep. In the morning, he was up betimes, and went straight to his\n",
      "bench and to work.\n",
      "\n",
      "On this second day, Mr. Lorry saluted him cheerfully by his name,\n",
      "and spoke to him on topics that had been of late familiar to them. He\n",
      "returned no reply, but it was evident that he heard what was said, and\n",
      "that he thought about it, however confusedly. This encouraged Mr. Lorry\n",
      "to have Miss Pross in with her work, several times during the day;\n",
      "at those times, they quietly spoke of Lucie, and of her father then\n",
      "present, precisely in the usual manner, and as if there were nothing\n",
      "amiss. This was done without any demonstrative accompaniment, not long\n",
      "enough, or often enough to harass him; and it lightened Mr. Lorry’s\n",
      "friendly heart to believe that he looked up oftener, and that he\n",
      "appeared to be stirred by some perception of inconsistencies surrounding\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it fell dark again, Mr. Lorry asked him as before:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dear Doctor, will you go out?”\n",
      "\n",
      "As before, he repeated, “Out?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes; for a walk with me. Why not?”\n",
      "\n",
      "This time, Mr. Lorry feigned to go out when he could extract no answer\n",
      "from him, and, after remaining absent for an hour, returned. In the\n",
      "meanwhile, the Doctor had removed to the seat in the window, and had\n",
      "sat there looking down at the plane-tree; but, on Mr. Lorry’s return, he\n",
      "slipped away to his bench.\n",
      "\n",
      "The time went very slowly on, and Mr. Lorry’s hope darkened, and his\n",
      "heart grew heavier again, and grew yet heavier and heavier every day.\n",
      "The third day came and went, the fourth, the fifth. Five days, six days,\n",
      "seven days, eight days, nine days.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a hope ever darkening, and with a heart always growing heavier and\n",
      "heavier, Mr. Lorry passed through this anxious time. The secret was\n",
      "well kept, and Lucie was unconscious and happy; but he could not fail to\n",
      "observe that the shoemaker, whose hand had been a little out at first,\n",
      "was growing dreadfully skilful, and that he had never been so intent on\n",
      "his work, and that his hands had never been so nimble and expert, as in\n",
      "the dusk of the ninth evening.\n",

      "\n",
      "CHAPTER XIX.\n",
      "An Opinion\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Worn out by anxious watching, Mr. Lorry fell asleep at his post. On the\n",
      "tenth morning of his suspense, he was startled by the shining of the sun\n",
      "into the room where a heavy slumber had overtaken him when it was dark\n",
      "night.\n",
      "\n",
      "He rubbed his eyes and roused himself; but he doubted, when he had\n",
      "done so, whether he was not still asleep. For, going to the door of the\n",
      "Doctor’s room and looking in, he perceived that the shoemaker’s bench\n",
      "and tools were put aside again, and that the Doctor himself sat reading\n",
      "at the window. He was in his usual morning dress, and his face (which\n",
      "Mr. Lorry could distinctly see), though still very pale, was calmly\n",
      "studious and attentive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even when he had satisfied himself that he was awake, Mr. Lorry felt\n",
      "giddily uncertain for some few moments whether the late shoemaking might\n",
      "not be a disturbed dream of his own; for, did not his eyes show him his\n",
      "friend before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect, and employed\n",
      "as usual; and was there any sign within their range, that the change of\n",
      "which he had so strong an impression had actually happened?\n",
      "\n",
      "It was but the inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment, the\n",
      "answer being obvious. If the impression were not produced by a real\n",
      "corresponding and sufficient cause, how came he, Jarvis Lorry, there?\n",
      "How came he to have fallen asleep, in his clothes, on the sofa in Doctor\n",
      "Manette’s consulting-room, and to be debating these points outside the\n",
      "Doctor’s bedroom door in the early morning?\n",
      "\n",
      "Within a few minutes, Miss Pross stood whispering at his side. If he\n",
      "had had any particle of doubt left, her talk would of necessity have\n",
      "resolved it; but he was by that time clear-headed, and had none.\n",
      "He advised that they should let the time go by until the regular\n",
      "breakfast-hour, and should then meet the Doctor as if nothing unusual\n",
      "had occurred. If he appeared to be in his customary state of mind, Mr.\n",
      "Lorry would then cautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from\n",
      "the opinion he had been, in his anxiety, so anxious to obtain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Pross, submitting herself to his judgment, the scheme was worked\n",
      "out with care. Having abundance of time for his usual methodical\n",
      "toilette, Mr. Lorry presented himself at the breakfast-hour in his usual\n",
      "white linen, and with his usual neat leg. The Doctor was summoned in the\n",
      "usual way, and came to breakfast.\n",
      "\n",
      "So far as it was possible to comprehend him without overstepping those\n",
      "delicate and gradual approaches which Mr. Lorry felt to be the only safe\n",
      "advance, he at first supposed that his daughter’s marriage had taken\n",
      "place yesterday. An incidental allusion, purposely thrown out, to\n",
      "the day of the week, and the day of the month, set him thinking and\n",
      "counting, and evidently made him uneasy. In all other respects, however,\n",
      "he was so composedly himself, that Mr. Lorry determined to have the aid\n",
      "he sought. And that aid was his own.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, when the breakfast was done and cleared away, and he and the\n",
      "Doctor were left together, Mr. Lorry said, feelingly:\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear Manette, I am anxious to have your opinion, in confidence, on a\n",
      "very curious case in which I am deeply interested; that is to say, it is\n",
      "very curious to me; perhaps, to your better information it may be less\n",
      "so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Glancing at his hands, which were discoloured by his late work, the\n",
      "Doctor looked troubled, and listened attentively. He had already glanced\n",
      "at his hands more than once.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Doctor Manette,” said Mr. Lorry, touching him affectionately on the\n",
      "arm, “the case is the case of a particularly dear friend of mine. Pray\n",
      "give your mind to it, and advise me well for his sake--and above all,\n",
      "for his daughter’s--his daughter’s, my dear Manette.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If I understand,” said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, “some mental\n",
      "shock--?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Be explicit,” said the Doctor. “Spare no detail.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lorry saw that they understood one another, and proceeded.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear Manette, it is the case of an old and a prolonged shock,\n",
      "of great acuteness and severity to the affections, the feelings,\n",
      "the--the--as you express it--the mind. The mind. It is the case of a\n",
      "shock under which the sufferer was borne down, one cannot say for how\n",
      "long, because I believe he cannot calculate the time himself, and there\n",
      "are no other means of getting at it. It is the case of a shock from\n",
      "which the sufferer recovered, by a process that he cannot trace\n",
      "himself--as I once heard him publicly relate in a striking manner. It is\n",
      "the case of a shock from which he has recovered, so completely, as to\n",
      "be a highly intelligent man, capable of close application of mind, and\n",
      "great exertion of body, and of constantly making fresh additions to his\n",
      "stock of knowledge, which was already very large. But, unfortunately,\n",
      "there has been,” he paused and took a deep breath--“a slight relapse.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Doctor, in a low voice, asked, “Of how long duration?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nine days and nights.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How did it show itself? I infer,” glancing at his hands again, “in the\n",
      "resumption of some old pursuit connected with the shock?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is the fact.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, did you ever see him,” asked the Doctor, distinctly and\n",
      "collectedly, though in the same low voice, “engaged in that pursuit\n",
      "originally?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Once.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And when the relapse fell on him, was he in most respects--or in all\n",
      "respects--as he was then?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think in all respects.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You spoke of his daughter. Does his daughter know of the relapse?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. It has been kept from her, and I hope will always be kept from her.\n",
      "It is known only to myself, and to one other who may be trusted.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Doctor grasped his hand, and murmured, “That was very kind. That was\n",
      "very thoughtful!” Mr. Lorry grasped his hand in return, and neither of\n",
      "the two spoke for a little while.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, my dear Manette,” said Mr. Lorry, at length, in his most\n",
      "considerate and most affectionate way, “I am a mere man of business,\n",
      "and unfit to cope with such intricate and difficult matters. I do not\n",
      "possess the kind of information necessary; I do not possess the kind of\n",
      "intelligence; I want guiding. There is no man in this world on whom\n",
      "I could so rely for right guidance, as on you. Tell me, how does this\n",
      "relapse come about? Is there danger of another? Could a repetition of it\n",
      "be prevented? How should a repetition of it be treated? How does it come\n",
      "about at all? What can I do for my friend? No man ever can have been\n",
      "more desirous in his heart to serve a friend, than I am to serve mine,\n",
      "if I knew how.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I don’t know how to originate, in such a case. If your sagacity,\n",
      "knowledge, and experience, could put me on the right track, I might be\n",
      "able to do so much; unenlightened and undirected, I can do so little.\n",
      "Pray discuss it with me; pray enable me to see it a little more clearly,\n",
      "and teach me how to be a little more useful.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Doctor Manette sat meditating after these earnest words were spoken, and\n",
      "Mr. Lorry did not press him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think it probable,” said the Doctor, breaking silence with an effort,\n",
      "“that the relapse you have described, my dear friend, was not quite\n",
      "unforeseen by its subject.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Was it dreaded by him?” Mr. Lorry ventured to ask.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very much.” He said it with an involuntary shudder.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have no idea how such an apprehension weighs on the sufferer’s\n",
      "mind, and how difficult--how almost impossible--it is, for him to force\n",
      "himself to utter a word upon the topic that oppresses him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Would he,” asked Mr. Lorry, “be sensibly relieved if he could prevail\n",
      "upon himself to impart that secret brooding to any one, when it is on\n",
      "him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think so. But it is, as I have told you, next to impossible. I even\n",
      "believe it--in some cases--to be quite impossible.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now,” said Mr. Lorry, gently laying his hand on the Doctor’s arm again,\n",
      "after a short silence on both sides, “to what would you refer this\n",
      "attack?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I believe,” returned Doctor Manette, “that there had been a strong and\n",
      "extraordinary revival of the train of thought and remembrance that\n",
      "was the first cause of the malady. Some intense associations of a most\n",
      "distressing nature were vividly recalled, I think. It is probable that\n",
      "there had long been a dread lurking in his mind, that those associations\n",
      "would be recalled--say, under certain circumstances--say, on a\n",
      "particular occasion. He tried to prepare himself in vain; perhaps the\n",
      "effort to prepare himself made him less able to bear it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Would he remember what took place in the relapse?” asked Mr. Lorry,\n",
      "with natural hesitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Doctor looked desolately round the room, shook his head, and\n",
      "answered, in a low voice, “Not at all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, as to the future,” hinted Mr. Lorry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As to the future,” said the Doctor, recovering firmness, “I should have\n",
      "great hope. As it pleased Heaven in its mercy to restore him so soon, I\n",
      "should have great hope. He, yielding under the pressure of a complicated\n",
      "something, long dreaded and long vaguely foreseen and contended against,\n",
      "and recovering after the cloud had burst and passed, I should hope that\n",
      "the worst was over.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, well! That’s good comfort. I am thankful!” said Mr. Lorry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am thankful!” repeated the Doctor, bending his head with reverence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There are two other points,” said Mr. Lorry, “on which I am anxious to\n",

      "confidence. He professed himself more relieved and encouraged than he\n",
      "really was, and approached his second and last point. He felt it to\n",
      "be the most difficult of all; but, remembering his old Sunday morning\n",

      "his pain so much, by substituting the perplexity of the fingers for\n",
      "the perplexity of the brain, and by substituting, as he became more\n",
      "practised, the ingenuity of the hands, for the ingenuity of the mental\n",
      "torture; that he has never been able to bear the thought of putting it\n",
      "quite out of his reach. Even now, when I believe he is more hopeful of\n",
      "himself than he has ever been, and even speaks of himself with a kind\n",
      "of confidence, the idea that he might need that old employment, and not\n",

      "When the newly-married pair came home, the first person who appeared, to\n",

      "many hours, when he presented himself. He was not improved in habits, or\n",

      "away. “On the drunken occasion in question (one of a large number, as\n",
      "you know), I was insufferable about liking you, and not liking you. I\n",

      "faith of a gentleman, that I have long dismissed it from my mind. Good\n",

      "A wonderful corner for echoes, it has been remarked, that corner where\n",

      "companion, in a life of quiet bliss, Lucie sat in the still house in\n",

      "years.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first, there were times, though she was a perfectly happy young wife,\n",
      "when her work would slowly fall from her hands, and her eyes would be\n",
      "dimmed. For, there was something coming in the echoes, something light,\n",
      "afar off, and scarcely audible yet, that stirred her heart too much.\n",
      "Fluttering hopes and doubts--hopes, of a love as yet unknown to her:\n",
      "doubts, of her remaining upon earth, to enjoy that new delight--divided\n",

      "footsteps at her own early grave; and thoughts of the husband who would\n",
      "be left so desolate, and who would mourn for her so much, swelled to her\n",
      "eyes, and broke like waves.\n",
      "\n",
      "That time passed, and her little Lucie lay on her bosom. Then, among the\n",
      "advancing echoes, there was the tread of her tiny feet and the sound of\n",
      "her prattling words. Let greater echoes resound as they would, the young\n",
      "mother at the cradle side could always hear those coming. They came, and\n",
      "the shady house was sunny with a child’s laugh, and the Divine friend of\n",
      "children, to whom in her trouble she had confided hers, seemed to take\n",

      "echoes of years none but friendly and soothing sounds. Her husband’s\n",
      "step was strong and prosperous among them; her father’s firm and equal.\n",
      "Lo, Miss Pross, in harness of string, awakening the echoes, as an\n",

      "Thus, the rustling of an Angel’s wings got blended with the other\n",

      "of Heaven. Sighs of the winds that blew over a little garden-tomb were\n",
      "mingled with them also, and both were audible to Lucie, in a hushed\n",
      "murmur--like the breathing of a summer sea asleep upon a sandy shore--as\n",

      "blameless though an unchanged mind, when she was a wife and a mother,\n",

      "delicacy of pity for him. What fine hidden sensibilities are touched in\n",
      "such a case, no echoes tell; but it is so, and it was so here. Carton\n",
      "was the first stranger to whom little Lucie held out her chubby arms,\n",

      "been close together during this brief discourse, and it had been as much\n",
      "as they could do to hear one another, even then: so tremendous was the\n",
      "noise of the living ocean, in its irruption into the Fortress, and\n",
      "its inundation of the courts and passages and staircases. All around\n",
      "outside, too, it beat the walls with a deep, hoarse roar, from which,\n",
      "occasionally, some partial shouts of tumult broke and leaped into the\n",
      "air like spray.\n",

      "Through gloomy vaults where the light of day had never shone, past\n",

      "there, especially at first, the inundation started on them and swept by;\n",
      "but when they had done descending, and were winding and climbing up a\n",

      "across, a few feet within. There was a heap of old feathery wood-ashes\n",

      "peering up the chimney, struck and prised at its sides with the crowbar,\n",
      "and worked at the iron grating across it. In a few minutes, some mortar\n",
      "and dust came dropping down, which he averted his face to avoid; and\n",
      "in it, and in the old wood-ashes, and in a crevice in the chimney\n",

      "again to come out at the low-arched door, they left it burning, and\n",
      "retraced their way to the courtyard; seeming to recover their sense\n",

      "Haggard Saint Antoine had had only one exultant week, in which to soften\n",
      "his modicum of hard and bitter bread to such extent as he could, with\n",
      "the relish of fraternal embraces and congratulations, when Madame\n",
      "Defarge sat at her counter, as usual, presiding over the customers.\n",
      "Madame Defarge wore no rose in her head, for the great brotherhood of\n",
      "Spies had become, even in one short week, extremely chary of trusting\n",

      "\n",
      "Madame Defarge, with her arms folded, sat in the morning light and heat,\n",
      "contemplating the wine-shop and the street. In both, there were several\n",
      "knots of loungers, squalid and miserable, but now with a manifest sense\n",
      "of power enthroned on their distress. The raggedest nightcap, awry on\n",
      "the wretchedest head, had this crooked significance in it: “I know how\n",
      "hard it has grown for me, the wearer of this, to support life in myself;\n",
      "but do you know how easy it has grown for me, the wearer of this, to\n",
      "destroy life in you?” Every lean bare arm, that had been without work\n",
      "before, had this work always ready for it now, that it could strike.\n",
      "The fingers of the knitting women were vicious, with the experience that\n",
      "they could tear. There was a change in the appearance of Saint Antoine;\n",
      "the image had been hammering into this for hundreds of years, and the\n",
      "last finishing blows had told mightily on the expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Defarge sat observing it, with such suppressed approval as was\n",

      "A moment of profound silence followed. Defarge and his wife looked\n",
      "steadfastly at one another. The Vengeance stooped, and the jar of a drum\n",
      "was heard as she moved it at her feet behind the counter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Patriots!” said Defarge, in a determined voice, “are we ready?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Instantly Madame Defarge’s knife was in her girdle; the drum was beating\n",

      "The Vengeance, uttering terrific shrieks, and flinging her arms about\n",
      "her head like all the forty Furies at once, was tearing from house to\n",
      "house, rousing the women.\n",
      "\n",
      "The men were terrible, in the bloody-minded anger with which they looked\n",
      "from windows, caught up what arms they had, and came pouring down into\n",
      "the streets; but, the women were a sight to chill the boldest. From\n",
      "such household occupations as their bare poverty yielded, from their\n",
      "children, from their aged and their sick crouching on the bare ground\n",
      "famished and naked, they ran out with streaming hair, urging one\n",
      "another, and themselves, to madness with the wildest cries and actions.\n",
      "Villain Foulon taken, my sister! Old Foulon taken, my mother! Miscreant\n",
      "Foulon taken, my daughter! Then, a score of others ran into the midst of\n",

      "alive! Foulon who told the starving people they might eat grass! Foulon\n",

      "Foulon to pieces, and dig him into the ground, that grass may grow from\n",
      "him! With these cries, numbers of the women, lashed into blind frenzy,\n",
      "whirled about, striking and tearing at their own friends until they\n",
      "dropped into a passionate swoon, and were only saved by the men\n",
      "belonging to them from being trampled under foot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, not a moment was lost; not a moment! This Foulon was at\n",
      "the Hotel de Ville, and might be loosed. Never, if Saint Antoine knew\n",
      "his own sufferings, insults, and wrongs! Armed men and women flocked out\n",
      "of the Quarter so fast, and drew even these last dregs after them with\n",
      "such a force of suction, that within a quarter of an hour there was not\n",
      "a human creature in Saint Antoine’s bosom but a few old crones and the\n",

      "No. They were all by that time choking the Hall of Examination where\n",

      "from him in the Hall.\n",
      "\n",
      "“See!” cried madame, pointing with her knife. “See the old villain bound\n",

      "clapping of hands. Similarly, during two or three hours of drawl,\n",
      "and the winnowing of many bushels of words, Madame Defarge’s frequent\n",
      "expressions of impatience were taken up, with marvellous quickness, at\n",
      "a distance: the more readily, because certain men who had by some\n",
      "wonderful exercise of agility climbed up the external architecture\n",
      "to look in from the windows, knew Madame Defarge well, and acted as a\n",
      "telegraph between her and the crowd outside the building.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length the sun rose so high that it struck a kindly ray as of hope or\n",

      "too much to bear; in an instant the barrier of dust and chaff that had\n",

      "him!\n",
      "\n",
      "It was known directly, to the furthest confines of the crowd. Defarge\n",
      "had but sprung over a railing and a table, and folded the miserable\n",
      "wretch in a deadly embrace--Madame Defarge had but followed and turned\n",
      "her hand in one of the ropes with which he was tied--The Vengeance and\n",
      "Jacques Three were not yet up with them, and the men at the windows\n",
      "had not yet swooped into the Hall, like birds of prey from their high\n",
      "perches--when the cry seemed to go up, all over the city, “Bring him\n",
      "out! Bring him to the lamp!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Down, and up, and head foremost on the steps of the building; now, on\n",
      "his knees; now, on his feet; now, on his back; dragged, and struck at,\n",
      "and stifled by the bunches of grass and straw that were thrust into his\n",
      "face by hundreds of hands; torn, bruised, panting, bleeding, yet always\n",
      "entreating and beseeching for mercy; now full of vehement agony of\n",
      "action, with a small clear space about him as the people drew one\n",
      "another back that they might see; now, a log of dead wood drawn through\n",
      "a forest of legs; he was hauled to the nearest street corner where one\n",
      "of the fatal lamps swung, and there Madame Defarge let him go--as a cat\n",
      "might have done to a mouse--and silently and composedly looked at him\n",
      "while they made ready, and while he besought her: the women passionately\n",
      "screeching at him all the time, and the men sternly calling out to have\n",
      "him killed with grass in his mouth. Once, he went aloft, and the rope\n",
      "broke, and they caught him shrieking; twice, he went aloft, and the rope\n",
      "broke, and they caught him shrieking; then, the rope was merciful, and\n",
      "held him, and his head was soon upon a pike, with grass enough in the\n",
      "mouth for all Saint Antoine to dance at the sight of.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor was this the end of the day’s bad work, for Saint Antoine so shouted\n",
      "and danced his angry blood up, that it boiled again, on hearing when\n",
      "the day closed in that the son-in-law of the despatched, another of the\n",
      "people’s enemies and insulters, was coming into Paris under a guard\n",
      "five hundred strong, in cavalry alone. Saint Antoine wrote his crimes\n",
      "on flaring sheets of paper, seized him--would have torn him out of the\n",
      "breast of an army to bear Foulon company--set his head and heart on\n",
      "pikes, and carried the three spoils of the day, in Wolf-procession\n",
      "through the streets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not before dark night did the men and women come back to the children,\n",

      "they waited with stomachs faint and empty, they beguiled the time by\n",
      "embracing one another on the triumphs of the day, and achieving them\n",
      "again in gossip. Gradually, these strings of ragged people shortened and\n",
      "frayed away; and then poor lights began to shine in high windows, and\n",
      "slender fires were made in the streets, at which neighbours cooked in\n",
      "common, afterwards supping at their doors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scanty and insufficient suppers those, and innocent of meat, as of\n",
      "most other sauce to wretched bread. Yet, human fellowship infused\n",
      "some nourishment into the flinty viands, and struck some sparks of\n",
      "cheerfulness out of them. Fathers and mothers who had had their full\n",

      "now, in place of his blue one) seemed fascinated by the figure on the\n",
      "heap of stones. His eyes were so often turned towards it, that he used\n",
      "his tools mechanically, and, one would have said, to very poor account.\n",
      "The bronze face, the shaggy black hair and beard, the coarse woollen\n",

      "beasts, the powerful frame attenuated by spare living, and the sullen\n",
      "and desperate compression of the lips in sleep, inspired the mender\n",
      "of roads with awe. The traveller had travelled far, and his feet were\n",
      "footsore, and his ankles chafed and bleeding; his great shoes, stuffed\n",
      "with leaves and grass, had been heavy to drag over the many long\n",
      "leagues, and his clothes were chafed into holes, as he himself was into\n",
      "sores. Stooping down beside him, the road-mender tried to get a peep at\n",
      "secret weapons in his breast or where not; but, in vain, for he slept\n",
      "with his arms crossed upon him, and set as resolutely as his lips.\n",
      "Fortified towns with their stockades, guard-houses, gates, trenches, and\n",
      "drawbridges, seemed to the mender of roads, to be so much air as against\n",
      "this figure. And when he lifted his eyes from it to the horizon and\n",
      "looked around, he saw in his small fancy similar figures, stopped by no\n",
      "obstacle, tending to centres all over France.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man slept on, indifferent to showers of hail and intervals of\n",
      "brightness, to sunshine on his face and shadow, to the paltering lumps\n",
      "of dull ice on his body and the diamonds into which the sun changed\n",
      "them, until the sun was low in the west, and the sky was glowing. Then,\n",
      "the mender of roads having got his tools together and all things ready\n",
      "to go down into the village, roused him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good!” said the sleeper, rising on his elbow. “Two leagues beyond the\n",
      "summit of the hill?”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“About. Good!”\n",

      "The mender of roads went home, with the dust going on before him\n",
      "according to the set of the wind, and was soon at the fountain,\n",
      "squeezing himself in among the lean kine brought there to drink, and\n",
      "appearing even to whisper to them in his whispering to all the village.\n",
      "When the village had taken its poor supper, it did not creep to bed,\n",
      "as it usually did, but came out of doors again, and remained there. A\n",
      "curious contagion of whispering was upon it, and also, when it gathered\n",
      "together at the fountain in the dark, another curious contagion of\n",
      "looking expectantly at the sky in one direction only. Monsieur Gabelle,\n",
      "chief functionary of the place, became uneasy; went out on his house-top\n",
      "alone, and looked in that direction too; glanced down from behind his\n",
      "chimneys at the darkening faces by the fountain below, and sent word to\n",
      "the sacristan who kept the keys of the church, that there might be need\n",
      "to ring the tocsin by-and-bye.\n",
      "\n",
      "The night deepened. The trees environing the old chateau, keeping its\n",
      "solitary state apart, moved in a rising wind, as though they threatened\n",
      "the pile of building massive and dark in the gloom. Up the two terrace\n",
      "flights of steps the rain ran wildly, and beat at the great door, like a\n",
      "swift messenger rousing those within; uneasy rushes of wind went through\n",
      "the hall, among the old spears and knives, and passed lamenting up the\n",
      "stairs, and shook the curtains of the bed where the last Marquis\n",
      "had slept. East, West, North, and South, through the woods, four\n",
      "heavy-treading, unkempt figures crushed the high grass and cracked the\n",
      "branches, striding on cautiously to come together in the courtyard. Four\n",
      "lights broke out there, and moved away in different directions, and all\n",
      "was black again.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, not for long. Presently, the chateau began to make itself strangely\n",
      "visible by some light of its own, as though it were growing luminous.\n",
      "Then, a flickering streak played behind the architecture of the front,\n",
      "picking out transparent places, and showing where balustrades, arches,\n",
      "and windows were. Then it soared higher, and grew broader and brighter.\n",
      "Soon, from a score of the great windows, flames burst forth, and the\n",
      "stone faces awakened, stared out of fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "A faint murmur arose about the house from the few people who were left\n",
      "there, and there was a saddling of a horse and riding away. There was\n",
      "spurring and splashing through the darkness, and bridle was drawn in the\n",
      "space by the village fountain, and the horse in a foam stood at Monsieur\n",
      "Gabelle’s door. “Help, Gabelle! Help, every one!” The tocsin rang\n",
      "impatiently, but other help (if that were any) there was none. The\n",
      "mender of roads, and two hundred and fifty particular friends, stood\n",
      "with folded arms at the fountain, looking at the pillar of fire in the\n",
      "sky. “It must be forty feet high,” said they, grimly; and never moved.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rider from the chateau, and the horse in a foam, clattered away\n",
      "through the village, and galloped up the stony steep, to the prison on\n",
      "the crag. At the gate, a group of officers were looking at the fire;\n",
      "removed from them, a group of soldiers. “Help, gentlemen--officers! The\n",
      "chateau is on fire; valuable objects may be saved from the flames by\n",
      "timely aid! Help, help!” The officers looked towards the soldiers who\n",
      "looked at the fire; gave no orders; and answered, with shrugs and biting\n",
      "of lips, “It must burn.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As the rider rattled down the hill again and through the street, the\n",
      "village was illuminating. The mender of roads, and the two hundred and\n",
      "fifty particular friends, inspired as one man and woman by the idea of\n",
      "lighting up, had darted into their houses, and were putting candles in\n",
      "every dull little pane of glass. The general scarcity of everything,\n",
      "occasioned candles to be borrowed in a rather peremptory manner of\n",
      "Monsieur Gabelle; and in a moment of reluctance and hesitation on\n",
      "that functionary’s part, the mender of roads, once so submissive to\n",
      "authority, had remarked that carriages were good to make bonfires with,\n",
      "and that post-horses would roast.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chateau was left to itself to flame and burn. In the roaring and\n",
      "raging of the conflagration, a red-hot wind, driving straight from the\n",
      "infernal regions, seemed to be blowing the edifice away. With the rising\n",
      "and falling of the blaze, the stone faces showed as if they were in\n",
      "torment. When great masses of stone and timber fell, the face with the\n",
      "two dints in the nose became obscured: anon struggled out of the smoke\n",
      "again, as if it were the face of the cruel Marquis, burning at the stake\n",
      "and contending with the fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chateau burned; the nearest trees, laid hold of by the fire,\n",
      "scorched and shrivelled; trees at a distance, fired by the four fierce\n",
      "figures, begirt the blazing edifice with a new forest of smoke. Molten\n",
      "lead and iron boiled in the marble basin of the fountain; the water ran\n",
      "dry; the extinguisher tops of the towers vanished like ice before the\n",
      "heat, and trickled down into four rugged wells of flame. Great rents and\n",
      "splits branched out in the solid walls, like crystallisation; stupefied\n",
      "birds wheeled about and dropped into the furnace; four fierce figures\n",
      "trudged away, East, West, North, and South, along the night-enshrouded\n",
      "roads, guided by the beacon they had lighted, towards their next\n",
      "destination. The illuminated village had seized hold of the tocsin, and,\n",
      "abolishing the lawful ringer, rang for joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not only that; but the village, light-headed with famine, fire, and\n",
      "bell-ringing, and bethinking itself that Monsieur Gabelle had to do with\n",
      "the collection of rent and taxes--though it was but a small instalment\n",
      "of taxes, and no rent at all, that Gabelle had got in those latter\n",
      "days--became impatient for an interview with him, and, surrounding his\n",
      "house, summoned him to come forth for personal conference. Whereupon,\n",
      "Monsieur Gabelle did heavily bar his door, and retire to hold counsel\n",
      "with himself. The result of that conference was, that Gabelle again\n",
      "withdrew himself to his housetop behind his stack of chimneys; this time\n",
      "resolved, if his door were broken in (he was a small Southern man\n",
      "of retaliative temperament), to pitch himself head foremost over the\n",
      "parapet, and crush a man or two below.\n",
      "\n",
      "Probably, Monsieur Gabelle passed a long night up there, with the\n",
      "distant chateau for fire and candle, and the beating at his door,\n",
      "combined with the joy-ringing, for music; not to mention his having an\n",
      "ill-omened lamp slung across the road before his posting-house gate,\n",
      "which the village showed a lively inclination to displace in his favour.\n",
      "A trying suspense, to be passing a whole summer night on the brink of\n",
      "the black ocean, ready to take that plunge into it upon which Monsieur\n",
      "Gabelle had resolved! But, the friendly dawn appearing at last, and the\n",
      "rush-candles of the village guttering out, the people happily dispersed,\n",
      "and Monsieur Gabelle came down bringing his life with him for that\n",
      "while.\n",
      "\n",
      "Within a hundred miles, and in the light of other fires, there were\n",
      "other functionaries less fortunate, that night and other nights, whom\n",

      "less fortunate than the mender of roads and his fellows, upon whom the\n",
      "functionaries and soldiery turned with success, and whom they strung up\n",
      "in their turn. But, the fierce figures were steadily wending East, West,\n",

      "\n",
      "The escorted governed his own horse, but a loose line was attached to\n",
      "his bridle, the end of which one of the patriots kept girded round his\n",
      "wrist. In this state they set forth with the sharp rain driving in their\n",
      "faces: clattering at a heavy dragoon trot over the uneven town pavement,\n",
      "and out upon the mire-deep roads. In this state they traversed without\n",
      "change, except of horses and pace, all the mire-deep leagues that lay\n",
      "between them and the capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "They travelled in the night, halting an hour or two after daybreak, and\n",
      "lying by until the twilight fell. The escort were so wretchedly clothed,\n",
      "that they twisted straw round their bare legs, and thatched their ragged\n",
      "shoulders to keep the wet off. Apart from the personal discomfort of\n",
      "being so attended, and apart from such considerations of present danger\n",
      "as arose from one of the patriots being chronically drunk, and carrying\n",
      "his musket very recklessly, Charles Darnay did not allow the restraint\n",
      "that was laid upon him to awaken any serious fears in his breast; for,\n",
      "he reasoned with himself that it could have no reference to the merits\n",
      "of an individual case that was not yet stated, and of representations,\n",
      "confirmable by the prisoner in the Abbaye, that were not yet made.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when they came to the town of Beauvais--which they did at eventide,\n",
      "when the streets were filled with people--he could not conceal from\n",
      "himself that the aspect of affairs was very alarming. An ominous crowd\n",
      "gathered to see him dismount of the posting-yard, and many voices called\n",
      "out loudly, “Down with the emigrant!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He stopped in the act of swinging himself out of his saddle, and,\n",
      "resuming it as his safest place, said:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Emigrant, my friends! Do you not see me here, in France, of my own\n",
      "will?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are a cursed emigrant,” cried a farrier, making at him in a\n",
      "furious manner through the press, hammer in hand; “and you are a cursed\n",
      "aristocrat!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The postmaster interposed himself between this man and the rider’s\n",
      "bridle (at which he was evidently making), and soothingly said, “Let him\n",
      "be; let him be! He will be judged at Paris.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Judged!” repeated the farrier, swinging his hammer. “Ay! and condemned\n",
      "as a traitor.” At this the crowd roared approval.\n",
      "\n",
      "Checking the postmaster, who was for turning his horse’s head to the\n",
      "yard (the drunken patriot sat composedly in his saddle looking on, with\n",
      "the line round his wrist), Darnay said, as soon as he could make his\n",
      "voice heard:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Friends, you deceive yourselves, or you are deceived. I am not a\n",
      "traitor.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He lies!” cried the smith. “He is a traitor since the decree. His life\n",
      "is forfeit to the people. His cursed life is not his own!”\n",
      "\n",
      "At the instant when Darnay saw a rush in the eyes of the crowd, which\n",
      "another instant would have brought upon him, the postmaster turned his\n",
      "horse into the yard, the escort rode in close upon his horse’s flanks,\n",
      "and the postmaster shut and barred the crazy double gates. The farrier\n",
      "struck a blow upon them with his hammer, and the crowd groaned; but, no\n",
      "more was done.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is this decree that the smith spoke of?” Darnay asked the\n",
      "postmaster, when he had thanked him, and stood beside him in the yard.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Truly, a decree for selling the property of emigrants.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“When passed?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“On the fourteenth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The day I left England!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Everybody says it is but one of several, and that there will be\n",
      "others--if there are not already--banishing all emigrants, and\n",
      "condemning all to death who return. That is what he meant when he said\n",
      "your life was not your own.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But there are no such decrees yet?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do I know!” said the postmaster, shrugging his shoulders; “there\n",
      "may be, or there will be. It is all the same. What would you have?”\n",
      "\n",
      "They rested on some straw in a loft until the middle of the night, and\n",
      "then rode forward again when all the town was asleep. Among the many\n",
      "wild changes observable on familiar things which made this wild ride\n",
      "unreal, not the least was the seeming rarity of sleep. After long and\n",
      "lonely spurring over dreary roads, they would come to a cluster of poor\n",
      "cottages, not steeped in darkness, but all glittering with lights, and\n",
      "would find the people, in a ghostly manner in the dead of the night,\n",
      "circling hand in hand round a shrivelled tree of Liberty, or all drawn\n",
      "up together singing a Liberty song. Happily, however, there was sleep in\n",
      "Beauvais that night to help them out of it and they passed on once more\n",
      "into solitude and loneliness: jingling through the untimely cold and\n",
      "wet, among impoverished fields that had yielded no fruits of the earth\n",
      "that year, diversified by the blackened remains of burnt houses, and by\n",
      "the sudden emergence from ambuscade, and sharp reining up across their\n",
      "way, of patriot patrols on the watch on all the roads.\n",
      "\n",
      "Daylight at last found them before the wall of Paris. The barrier was\n",
      "closed and strongly guarded when they rode up to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where are the papers of this prisoner?” demanded a resolute-looking man\n",
      "in authority, who was summoned out by the guard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Naturally struck by the disagreeable word, Charles Darnay requested the\n",
      "speaker to take notice that he was a free traveller and French citizen,\n",
      "in charge of an escort which the disturbed state of the country had\n",
      "imposed upon him, and which he had paid for.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where,” repeated the same personage, without taking any heed of him\n",
      "whatever, “are the papers of this prisoner?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The drunken patriot had them in his cap, and produced them. Casting his\n",
      "eyes over Gabelle’s letter, the same personage in authority showed some\n",
      "disorder and surprise, and looked at Darnay with a close attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "He left escort and escorted without saying a word, however, and went\n",
      "into the guard-room; meanwhile, they sat upon their horses outside the\n",
      "gate. Looking about him while in this state of suspense, Charles\n",
      "Darnay observed that the gate was held by a mixed guard of soldiers and\n",
      "patriots, the latter far outnumbering the former; and that while ingress\n",
      "into the city for peasants’ carts bringing in supplies, and for similar\n",
      "traffic and traffickers, was easy enough, egress, even for the homeliest\n",
      "people, was very difficult. A numerous medley of men and women, not\n",
      "to mention beasts and vehicles of various sorts, was waiting to issue\n",
      "forth; but, the previous identification was so strict, that they\n",
      "filtered through the barrier very slowly. Some of these people knew\n",
      "their turn for examination to be so far off, that they lay down on the\n",
      "ground to sleep or smoke, while others talked together, or loitered\n",
      "about. The red cap and tri-colour cockade were universal, both among men\n",
      "and women.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he had sat in his saddle some half-hour, taking note of these\n",
      "things, Darnay found himself confronted by the same man in authority,\n",
      "who directed the guard to open the barrier. Then he delivered to the\n",
      "escort, drunk and sober, a receipt for the escorted, and requested him\n",
      "to dismount. He did so, and the two patriots, leading his tired horse,\n",
      "turned and rode away without entering the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "He accompanied his conductor into a guard-room, smelling of common wine\n",
      "and tobacco, where certain soldiers and patriots, asleep and awake,\n",
      "drunk and sober, and in various neutral states between sleeping and\n",
      "waking, drunkenness and sobriety, were standing and lying about. The\n",
      "light in the guard-house, half derived from the waning oil-lamps of\n",
      "the night, and half from the overcast day, was in a correspondingly\n",
      "uncertain condition. Some registers were lying open on a desk, and an\n",
      "officer of a coarse, dark aspect, presided over these.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Citizen Defarge,” said he to Darnay’s conductor, as he took a slip of\n",
      "paper to write on. “Is this the emigrant Evrémonde?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is the man.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your age, Evrémonde?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thirty-seven.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Married, Evrémonde?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where married?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In England.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Without doubt. Where is your wife, Evrémonde?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In England.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Without doubt. You are consigned, Evrémonde, to the prison of La\n",
      "Force.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Just Heaven!” exclaimed Darnay. “Under what law, and for what offence?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The officer looked up from his slip of paper for a moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We have new laws, Evrémonde, and new offences, since you were here.” He\n",
      "said it with a hard smile, and went on writing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I entreat you to observe that I have come here voluntarily, in response\n",
      "to that written appeal of a fellow-countryman which lies before you. I\n",
      "demand no more than the opportunity to do so without delay. Is not that\n",
      "my right?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Emigrants have no rights, Evrémonde,” was the stolid reply. The officer\n",
      "wrote until he had finished, read over to himself what he had written,\n",
      "sanded it, and handed it to Defarge, with the words “In secret.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Defarge motioned with the paper to the prisoner that he must accompany\n",
      "him. The prisoner obeyed, and a guard of two armed patriots attended\n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is it you,” said Defarge, in a low voice, as they went down the\n",
      "guardhouse steps and turned into Paris, “who married the daughter of\n",
      "Doctor Manette, once a prisoner in the Bastille that is no more?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” replied Darnay, looking at him with surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My name is Defarge, and I keep a wine-shop in the Quarter Saint\n",
      "Antoine. Possibly you have heard of me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My wife came to your house to reclaim her father? Yes!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The word “wife” seemed to serve as a gloomy reminder to Defarge, to say\n",
      "with sudden impatience, “In the name of that sharp female newly-born,\n",
      "and called La Guillotine, why did you come to France?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You heard me say why, a minute ago. Do you not believe it is the\n",
      "truth?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A bad truth for you,” said Defarge, speaking with knitted brows, and\n",
      "looking straight before him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed I am lost here. All here is so unprecedented, so changed, so\n",
      "sudden and unfair, that I am absolutely lost. Will you render me a\n",
      "little help?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“None.” Defarge spoke, always looking straight before him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Will you answer me a single question?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perhaps. According to its nature. You can say what it is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In this prison that I am going to so unjustly, shall I have some free\n",
      "communication with the world outside?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You will see.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am not to be buried there, prejudged, and without any means of\n",
      "presenting my case?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You will see. But, what then? Other people have been similarly buried\n",
      "in worse prisons, before now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But never by me, Citizen Defarge.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Defarge glanced darkly at him for answer, and walked on in a steady\n",
      "and set silence. The deeper he sank into this silence, the fainter hope\n",
      "there was--or so Darnay thought--of his softening in any slight degree.\n",
      "He, therefore, made haste to say:\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is of the utmost importance to me (you know, Citizen, even better\n",
      "than I, of how much importance), that I should be able to communicate to\n",
      "Mr. Lorry of Tellson’s Bank, an English gentleman who is now in Paris,\n",
      "the simple fact, without comment, that I have been thrown into the\n",
      "prison of La Force. Will you cause that to be done for me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will do,” Defarge doggedly rejoined, “nothing for you. My duty is to\n",
      "my country and the People. I am the sworn servant of both, against you.\n",
      "I will do nothing for you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Charles Darnay felt it hopeless to entreat him further, and his pride\n",
      "was touched besides. As they walked on in silence, he could not but see\n",
      "how used the people were to the spectacle of prisoners passing along the\n",
      "streets. The very children scarcely noticed him. A few passers turned\n",
      "their heads, and a few shook their fingers at him as an aristocrat;\n",
      "otherwise, that a man in good clothes should be going to prison, was no\n",
      "more remarkable than that a labourer in working clothes should be\n",
      "going to work. In one narrow, dark, and dirty street through which they\n",
      "passed, an excited orator, mounted on a stool, was addressing an excited\n",
      "audience on the crimes against the people, of the king and the royal\n",
      "family. The few words that he caught from this man’s lips, first made\n",
      "it known to Charles Darnay that the king was in prison, and that the\n",
      "foreign ambassadors had one and all left Paris. On the road (except at\n",
      "Beauvais) he had heard absolutely nothing. The escort and the universal\n",
      "watchfulness had completely isolated him.\n",
      "\n",
      "That he had fallen among far greater dangers than those which had\n",
      "developed themselves when he left England, he of course knew now. That\n",
      "perils had thickened about him fast, and might thicken faster and faster\n",
      "yet, he of course knew now. He could not but admit to himself that he\n",
      "might not have made this journey, if he could have foreseen the events\n",
      "of a few days. And yet his misgivings were not so dark as, imagined by\n",
      "the light of this later time, they would appear. Troubled as the future\n",
      "was, it was the unknown future, and in its obscurity there was ignorant\n",
      "hope. The horrible massacre, days and nights long, which, within a few\n",
      "rounds of the clock, was to set a great mark of blood upon the blessed\n",
      "garnering time of harvest, was as far out of his knowledge as if it had\n",
      "been a hundred thousand years away. The “sharp female newly-born, and\n",
      "called La Guillotine,” was hardly known to him, or to the generality\n",
      "of people, by name. The frightful deeds that were to be soon done, were\n",
      "probably unimagined at that time in the brains of the doers. How could\n",
      "they have a place in the shadowy conceptions of a gentle mind?\n",
      "\n",
      "Of unjust treatment in detention and hardship, and in cruel separation\n",
      "from his wife and child, he foreshadowed the likelihood, or the\n",
      "certainty; but, beyond this, he dreaded nothing distinctly. With this on\n",
      "his mind, which was enough to carry into a dreary prison courtyard, he\n",
      "arrived at the prison of La Force.\n",
      "\n",
      "A man with a bloated face opened the strong wicket, to whom Defarge\n",
      "presented “The Emigrant Evrémonde.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What the Devil! How many more of them!” exclaimed the man with the\n",
      "bloated face.\n",
      "\n",
      "Defarge took his receipt without noticing the exclamation, and withdrew,\n",
      "with his two fellow-patriots.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What the Devil, I say again!” exclaimed the gaoler, left with his wife.\n",
      "“How many more!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The gaoler’s wife, being provided with no answer to the question, merely\n",
      "replied, “One must have patience, my dear!” Three turnkeys who entered\n",
      "responsive to a bell she rang, echoed the sentiment, and one added, “For\n",
      "the love of Liberty;” which sounded in that place like an inappropriate\n",
      "conclusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prison of La Force was a gloomy prison, dark and filthy, and with a\n",
      "horrible smell of foul sleep in it. Extraordinary how soon the noisome\n",
      "flavour of imprisoned sleep, becomes manifest in all such places that\n",
      "are ill cared for!\n",
      "\n",
      "“In secret, too,” grumbled the gaoler, looking at the written paper. “As\n",
      "if I was not already full to bursting!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He stuck the paper on a file, in an ill-humour, and Charles Darnay\n",
      "awaited his further pleasure for half an hour: sometimes, pacing to and\n",
      "fro in the strong arched room: sometimes, resting on a stone seat: in\n",
      "either case detained to be imprinted on the memory of the chief and his\n",
      "subordinates.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come!” said the chief, at length taking up his keys, “come with me,\n",
      "emigrant.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Through the dismal prison twilight, his new charge accompanied him by\n",
      "corridor and staircase, many doors clanging and locking behind them,\n",
      "until they came into a large, low, vaulted chamber, crowded with\n",
      "prisoners of both sexes. The women were seated at a long table, reading\n",
      "and writing, knitting, sewing, and embroidering; the men were for the\n",
      "most part standing behind their chairs, or lingering up and down the\n",
      "room.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the instinctive association of prisoners with shameful crime and\n",
      "disgrace, the new-comer recoiled from this company. But the crowning\n",
      "unreality of his long unreal ride, was, their all at once rising to\n",
      "receive him, with every refinement of manner known to the time, and with\n",
      "all the engaging graces and courtesies of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "So strangely clouded were these refinements by the prison manners and\n",
      "gloom, so spectral did they become in the inappropriate squalor and\n",
      "misery through which they were seen, that Charles Darnay seemed to stand\n",
      "in a company of the dead. Ghosts all! The ghost of beauty, the ghost\n",
      "of stateliness, the ghost of elegance, the ghost of pride, the ghost of\n",
      "frivolity, the ghost of wit, the ghost of youth, the ghost of age, all\n",
      "waiting their dismissal from the desolate shore, all turning on him eyes\n",
      "that were changed by the death they had died in coming there.\n",
      "\n",
      "It struck him motionless. The gaoler standing at his side, and the other\n",
      "gaolers moving about, who would have been well enough as to appearance\n",
      "in the ordinary exercise of their functions, looked so extravagantly\n",
      "coarse contrasted with sorrowing mothers and blooming daughters who were\n",
      "there--with the apparitions of the coquette, the young beauty, and the\n",
      "mature woman delicately bred--that the inversion of all experience and\n",
      "likelihood which the scene of shadows presented, was heightened to its\n",
      "utmost. Surely, ghosts all. Surely, the long unreal ride some progress\n",
      "of disease that had brought him to these gloomy shades!\n",
      "\n",
      "“In the name of the assembled companions in misfortune,” said a\n",
      "gentleman of courtly appearance and address, coming forward, “I have the\n",
      "honour of giving you welcome to La Force, and of condoling with you\n",
      "on the calamity that has brought you among us. May it soon terminate\n",
      "happily! It would be an impertinence elsewhere, but it is not so here,\n",
      "to ask your name and condition?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Charles Darnay roused himself, and gave the required information, in\n",
      "words as suitable as he could find.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I hope,” said the gentleman, following the chief gaoler with his\n",
      "eyes, who moved across the room, “that you are not in secret?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not understand the meaning of the term, but I have heard them say\n",
      "so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, what a pity! We so much regret it! But take courage; several\n",
      "members of our society have been in secret, at first, and it has lasted\n",
      "but a short time.” Then he added, raising his voice, “I grieve to inform\n",
      "the society--in secret.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a murmur of commiseration as Charles Darnay crossed the room\n",
      "to a grated door where the gaoler awaited him, and many voices--among\n",
      "which, the soft and compassionate voices of women were conspicuous--gave\n",
      "him good wishes and encouragement. He turned at the grated door, to\n",
      "render the thanks of his heart; it closed under the gaoler’s hand; and\n",
      "the apparitions vanished from his sight forever.\n",

      "ascended forty steps (the prisoner of half an hour already counted\n",
      "them), the gaoler opened a low black door, and they passed into a\n",
      "solitary cell. It struck cold and damp, but was not dark.\n",

      "the prisoner leaning against the wall opposite to him, that this gaoler\n",
      "was so unwholesomely bloated, both in face and person, as to look like\n",
      "a man who had been drowned and filled with water. When the gaoler was\n",
      "gone, he thought in the same wandering way, “Now am I left, as if I were\n",
      "dead.” Stopping then, to look down at the mattress, he turned from it\n",
      "with a sick feeling, and thought, “And here in these crawling creatures\n",
      "is the first condition of the body after death.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Five paces by four and a half, five paces by four and a half, five\n",

      "drums with a wild swell of voices added to them. “He made shoes, he made\n",
      "shoes, he made shoes.” The prisoner counted the measurement again, and\n",
      "paced faster, to draw his mind with him from that latter repetition.\n",
      "“The ghosts that vanished when the wicket closed. There was one among\n",
      "them, the appearance of a lady dressed in black, who was leaning in the\n",
      "embrasure of a window, and she had a light shining upon her golden\n",
      "hair, and she looked like * * * * Let us ride on again, for God’s sake,\n",
      "through the illuminated villages with the people all awake! * * * * He\n",
      "made shoes, he made shoes, he made shoes. * * * * Five paces by four and\n",
      "a half.” With such scraps tossing and rolling upward from the depths of\n",
      "his mind, the prisoner walked faster and faster, obstinately counting\n",
      "and counting; and the roar of the city changed to this extent--that it\n",
      "still rolled in like muffled drums, but with the wail of voices that he\n",
      "knew, in the swell that rose above them.\n",

      "Tellson’s Bank, established in the Saint Germain Quarter of Paris, was\n",
      "in a wing of a large house, approached by a courtyard and shut off from\n",
      "the street by a high wall and a strong gate. The house belonged to\n",
      "a great nobleman who had lived in it until he made a flight from the\n",
      "troubles, in his own cook’s dress, and got across the borders. A\n",
      "mere beast of the chase flying from hunters, he was still in his\n",
      "metempsychosis no other than the same Monseigneur, the preparation\n",
      "of whose chocolate for whose lips had once occupied three strong men\n",
      "besides the cook in question.\n",
      "\n",
      "Monseigneur gone, and the three strong men absolving themselves from the\n",

      "willing to cut his throat on the altar of the dawning Republic one and\n",
      "indivisible of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, Monseigneur’s\n",
      "house had been first sequestrated, and then confiscated. For, all\n",
      "things moved so fast, and decree followed decree with that fierce\n",
      "precipitation, that now upon the third night of the autumn month\n",
      "of September, patriot emissaries of the law were in possession of\n",
      "Monseigneur’s house, and had marked it with the tri-colour, and were\n",
      "drinking brandy in its state apartments.\n",
      "\n",
      "A place of business in London like Tellson’s place of business in Paris,\n",
      "would soon have driven the House out of its mind and into the Gazette.\n",
      "For, what would staid British responsibility and respectability have\n",
      "said to orange-trees in boxes in a Bank courtyard, and even to a Cupid\n",
      "over the counter? Yet such things were. Tellson’s had whitewashed the\n",
      "Cupid, but he was still to be seen on the ceiling, in the coolest\n",
      "linen, aiming (as he very often does) at money from morning to\n",
      "night. Bankruptcy must inevitably have come of this young Pagan, in\n",
      "Lombard-street, London, and also of a curtained alcove in the rear of\n",
      "the immortal boy, and also of a looking-glass let into the wall, and\n",
      "also of clerks not at all old, who danced in public on the slightest\n",
      "provocation. Yet, a French Tellson’s could get on with these things\n",
      "exceedingly well, and, as long as the times held together, no man had\n",
      "taken fright at them, and drawn out his money.\n",
      "\n",
      "What money would be drawn out of Tellson’s henceforth, and what would\n",

      "and when they should have violently perished; how many accounts with\n",
      "Tellson’s never to be balanced in this world, must be carried over into\n",
      "the next; no man could have said, that night, any more than Mr. Jarvis\n",
      "Lorry could, though he thought heavily of these questions. He sat by\n",
      "a newly-lighted wood fire (the blighted and unfruitful year was\n",
      "prematurely cold), and on his honest and courageous face there was a\n",
      "deeper shade than the pendent lamp could throw, or any object in the\n",
      "room distortedly reflect--a shade of horror.\n",
      "\n",
      "He occupied rooms in the Bank, in his fidelity to the House of which\n",
      "he had grown to be a part, like strong root-ivy. It chanced that they\n",
      "derived a kind of security from the patriotic occupation of the main\n",
      "building, but the true-hearted old gentleman never calculated about\n",
      "that. All such circumstances were indifferent to him, so that he did\n",
      "his duty. On the opposite side of the courtyard, under a colonnade,\n",
      "was extensive standing--for carriages--where, indeed, some carriages\n",
      "of Monseigneur yet stood. Against two of the pillars were fastened two\n",
      "great flaring flambeaux, and in the light of these, standing out in the\n",
      "open air, was a large grindstone: a roughly mounted thing which appeared\n",
      "to have hurriedly been brought there from some neighbouring smithy,\n",
      "or other workshop. Rising and looking out of window at these harmless\n",
      "objects, Mr. Lorry shivered, and retired to his seat by the fire. He had\n",
      "opened, not only the glass window, but the lattice blind outside it, and\n",
      "he had closed both again, and he shivered through his frame.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the streets beyond the high wall and the strong gate, there came\n",
      "the usual night hum of the city, with now and then an indescribable ring\n",
      "in it, weird and unearthly, as if some unwonted sounds of a terrible\n",
      "nature were going up to Heaven.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thank God,” said Mr. Lorry, clasping his hands, “that no one near and\n",

      "who are in danger!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon afterwards, the bell at the great gate sounded, and he thought,\n",
      "“They have come back!” and sat listening. But, there was no loud\n",
      "irruption into the courtyard, as he had expected, and he heard the gate\n",
      "clash again, and all was quiet.\n",
      "\n",
      "The nervousness and dread that were upon him inspired that vague\n",
      "uneasiness respecting the Bank, which a great change would naturally\n",
      "awaken, with such feelings roused. It was well guarded, and he got up to\n",
      "go among the trusty people who were watching it, when his door suddenly\n",
      "opened, and two figures rushed in, at sight of which he fell back in\n",
      "amazement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lucie and her father! Lucie with her arms stretched out to him, and with\n",
      "that old look of earnestness so concentrated and intensified, that it\n",
      "seemed as though it had been stamped upon her face expressly to give\n",
      "force and power to it in this one passage of her life.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is this?” cried Mr. Lorry, breathless and confused. “What is the\n",
      "matter? Lucie! Manette! What has happened? What has brought you here?\n",
      "What is it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "With the look fixed upon him, in her paleness and wildness, she panted\n",
      "out in his arms, imploringly, “O my dear friend! My husband!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your husband, Lucie?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Charles.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Has been here some days--three or four--I don’t know how many--I can’t\n",
      "collect my thoughts. An errand of generosity brought him here unknown to\n",
      "us; he was stopped at the barrier, and sent to prison.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The old man uttered an irrepressible cry. Almost at the same moment, the\n",
      "bell of the great gate rang again, and a loud noise of feet and voices\n",
      "came pouring into the courtyard.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is that noise?” said the Doctor, turning towards the window.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t look!” cried Mr. Lorry. “Don’t look out! Manette, for your life,\n",
      "don’t touch the blind!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Doctor turned, with his hand upon the fastening of the window, and\n",
      "said, with a cool, bold smile:\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear friend, I have a charmed life in this city. I have been\n",
      "a Bastille prisoner. There is no patriot in Paris--in Paris? In\n",
      "France--who, knowing me to have been a prisoner in the Bastille, would\n",
      "touch me, except to overwhelm me with embraces, or carry me in triumph.\n",
      "My old pain has given me a power that has brought us through the\n",
      "barrier, and gained us news of Charles there, and brought us here. I\n",
      "knew it would be so; I knew I could help Charles out of all danger; I\n",
      "told Lucie so.--What is that noise?” His hand was again upon the window.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t look!” cried Mr. Lorry, absolutely desperate. “No, Lucie, my\n",
      "dear, nor you!” He got his arm round her, and held her. “Don’t be so\n",
      "terrified, my love. I solemnly swear to you that I know of no harm\n",
      "having happened to Charles; that I had no suspicion even of his being in\n",
      "this fatal place. What prison is he in?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“La Force!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“La Force! Lucie, my child, if ever you were brave and serviceable in\n",
      "your life--and you were always both--you will compose yourself now, to\n",
      "do exactly as I bid you; for more depends upon it than you can think, or\n",
      "I can say. There is no help for you in any action on your part to-night;\n",
      "you cannot possibly stir out. I say this, because what I must bid you\n",
      "to do for Charles’s sake, is the hardest thing to do of all. You must\n",
      "instantly be obedient, still, and quiet. You must let me put you in a\n",
      "room at the back here. You must leave your father and me alone for\n",
      "two minutes, and as there are Life and Death in the world you must not\n",
      "delay.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will be submissive to you. I see in your face that you know I can do\n",
      "nothing else than this. I know you are true.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The old man kissed her, and hurried her into his room, and turned the\n",
      "key; then, came hurrying back to the Doctor, and opened the window and\n",
      "partly opened the blind, and put his hand upon the Doctor’s arm, and\n",
      "looked out with him into the courtyard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looked out upon a throng of men and women: not enough in number, or near\n",
      "enough, to fill the courtyard: not more than forty or fifty in all. The\n",
      "people in possession of the house had let them in at the gate, and they\n",
      "had rushed in to work at the grindstone; it had evidently been set up\n",
      "there for their purpose, as in a convenient and retired spot.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, such awful workers, and such awful work!\n",
      "\n",
      "The grindstone had a double handle, and, turning at it madly were two\n",
      "men, whose faces, as their long hair flapped back when the whirlings of\n",
      "the grindstone brought their faces up, were more horrible and cruel than\n",
      "the visages of the wildest savages in their most barbarous disguise.\n",
      "False eyebrows and false moustaches were stuck upon them, and their\n",
      "hideous countenances were all bloody and sweaty, and all awry with\n",
      "howling, and all staring and glaring with beastly excitement and want of\n",
      "sleep. As these ruffians turned and turned, their matted locks now flung\n",
      "forward over their eyes, now flung backward over their necks, some women\n",
      "held wine to their mouths that they might drink; and what with dropping\n",
      "blood, and what with dropping wine, and what with the stream of sparks\n",
      "struck out of the stone, all their wicked atmosphere seemed gore and\n",
      "fire. The eye could not detect one creature in the group free from\n",
      "the smear of blood. Shouldering one another to get next at the\n",
      "sharpening-stone, were men stripped to the waist, with the stain all\n",
      "over their limbs and bodies; men in all sorts of rags, with the stain\n",
      "upon those rags; men devilishly set off with spoils of women’s lace\n",
      "and silk and ribbon, with the stain dyeing those trifles through\n",
      "and through. Hatchets, knives, bayonets, swords, all brought to be\n",
      "sharpened, were all red with it. Some of the hacked swords were tied to\n",
      "the wrists of those who carried them, with strips of linen and fragments\n",
      "of dress: ligatures various in kind, but all deep of the one colour. And\n",
      "as the frantic wielders of these weapons snatched them from the stream\n",
      "of sparks and tore away into the streets, the same red hue was red in\n",
      "their frenzied eyes;--eyes which any unbrutalised beholder would have\n",
      "given twenty years of life, to petrify with a well-directed gun.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this was seen in a moment, as the vision of a drowning man, or of\n",
      "any human creature at any very great pass, could see a world if it\n",
      "were there. They drew back from the window, and the Doctor looked for\n",
      "explanation in his friend’s ashy face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They are,” Mr. Lorry whispered the words, glancing fearfully round at\n",
      "the locked room, “murdering the prisoners. If you are sure of what you\n",
      "say; if you really have the power you think you have--as I believe you\n",
      "have--make yourself known to these devils, and get taken to La Force. It\n",
      "may be too late, I don’t know, but let it not be a minute later!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Doctor Manette pressed his hand, hastened bareheaded out of the room,\n",
      "and was in the courtyard when Mr. Lorry regained the blind.\n",
      "\n",
      "His streaming white hair, his remarkable face, and the impetuous\n",
      "confidence of his manner, as he put the weapons aside like water,\n",
      "carried him in an instant to the heart of the concourse at the stone.\n",
      "For a few moments there was a pause, and a hurry, and a murmur, and\n",
      "the unintelligible sound of his voice; and then Mr. Lorry saw him,\n",
      "surrounded by all, and in the midst of a line of twenty men long, all\n",
      "linked shoulder to shoulder, and hand to shoulder, hurried out with\n",
      "cries of--“Live the Bastille prisoner! Help for the Bastille prisoner’s\n",
      "kindred in La Force! Room for the Bastille prisoner in front there! Save\n",
      "the prisoner Evrémonde at La Force!” and a thousand answering shouts.\n",
      "\n",
      "He closed the lattice again with a fluttering heart, closed the window\n",
      "and the curtain, hastened to Lucie, and told her that her father was\n",
      "assisted by the people, and gone in search of her husband. He found\n",
      "her child and Miss Pross with her; but, it never occurred to him to be\n",
      "surprised by their appearance until a long time afterwards, when he sat\n",
      "watching them in such quiet as the night knew.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lucie had, by that time, fallen into a stupor on the floor at his feet,\n",
      "clinging to his hand. Miss Pross had laid the child down on his own\n",
      "bed, and her head had gradually fallen on the pillow beside her pretty\n",
      "charge. O the long, long night, with the moans of the poor wife! And O\n",
      "the long, long night, with no return of her father and no tidings!\n",
      "\n",
      "Twice more in the darkness the bell at the great gate sounded, and the\n",
      "irruption was repeated, and the grindstone whirled and spluttered.\n",
      "“What is it?” cried Lucie, affrighted. “Hush! The soldiers’ swords are\n",
      "sharpened there,” said Mr. Lorry. “The place is national property now,\n",
      "and used as a kind of armoury, my love.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Twice more in all; but, the last spell of work was feeble and fitful.\n",
      "Soon afterwards the day began to dawn, and he softly detached himself\n",
      "from the clasping hand, and cautiously looked out again. A man, so\n",
      "besmeared that he might have been a sorely wounded soldier creeping back\n",
      "to consciousness on a field of slain, was rising from the pavement by\n",
      "the side of the grindstone, and looking about him with a vacant air.\n",
      "Shortly, this worn-out murderer descried in the imperfect light one of\n",
      "the carriages of Monseigneur, and, staggering to that gorgeous vehicle,\n",
      "climbed in at the door, and shut himself up to take his rest on its\n",
      "dainty cushions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The great grindstone, Earth, had turned when Mr. Lorry looked out again,\n",
      "and the sun was red on the courtyard. But, the lesser grindstone stood\n",
      "alone there in the calm morning air, with a red upon it that the sun had\n",
      "never given, and would never take away.\n",

      "CHAPTER III.\n",
      "The Shadow\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the first considerations which arose in the business mind of Mr.\n",
      "Lorry when business hours came round, was this:--that he had no right to\n",
      "imperil Tellson’s by sheltering the wife of an emigrant prisoner under\n",
      "the Bank roof. His own possessions, safety, life, he would have hazarded\n",
      "for Lucie and her child, without a moment’s demur; but the great trust\n",
      "he held was not his own, and as to that business charge he was a strict\n",
      "man of business.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first, his mind reverted to Defarge, and he thought of finding out\n",
      "the wine-shop again and taking counsel with its master in reference to\n",
      "the safest dwelling-place in the distracted state of the city. But, the\n",
      "same consideration that suggested him, repudiated him; he lived in the\n",
      "most violent Quarter, and doubtless was influential there, and deep in\n",
      "its dangerous workings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Noon coming, and the Doctor not returning, and every minute’s delay\n",
      "tending to compromise Tellson’s, Mr. Lorry advised with Lucie. She said\n",
      "that her father had spoken of hiring a lodging for a short term, in that\n",
      "Quarter, near the Banking-house. As there was no business objection to\n",
      "this, and as he foresaw that even if it were all well with Charles, and\n",
      "he were to be released, he could not hope to leave the city, Mr. Lorry\n",
      "went out in quest of such a lodging, and found a suitable one, high up\n",
      "in a removed by-street where the closed blinds in all the other windows\n",
      "of a high melancholy square of buildings marked deserted homes.\n",
      "\n",
      "To this lodging he at once removed Lucie and her child, and Miss Pross:\n",
      "giving them what comfort he could, and much more than he had himself.\n",
      "He left Jerry with them, as a figure to fill a doorway that would bear\n",
      "considerable knocking on the head, and returned to his own occupations.\n",
      "A disturbed and doleful mind he brought to bear upon them, and slowly\n",
      "and heavily the day lagged on with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "It wore itself out, and wore him out with it, until the Bank closed. He\n",
      "was again alone in his room of the previous night, considering what to\n",
      "do next, when he heard a foot upon the stair. In a few moments, a\n",
      "man stood in his presence, who, with a keenly observant look at him,\n",
      "addressed him by his name.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your servant,” said Mr. Lorry. “Do you know me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He was a strongly made man with dark curling hair, from forty-five\n",
      "to fifty years of age. For answer he repeated, without any change of\n",
      "emphasis, the words:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you know me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have seen you somewhere.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perhaps at my wine-shop?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Much interested and agitated, Mr. Lorry said: “You come from Doctor\n",
      "Manette?”\n",

      "\n",
      "    “Charles is safe, but I cannot safely leave this place yet.\n",
      "     I have obtained the favour that the bearer has a short note\n",
      "     from Charles to his wife.  Let the bearer see his wife.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was dated from La Force, within an hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Will you accompany me,” said Mr. Lorry, joyfully relieved after reading\n",
      "this note aloud, “to where his wife resides?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” returned Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scarcely noticing as yet, in what a curiously reserved and mechanical\n",
      "way Defarge spoke, Mr. Lorry put on his hat and they went down into the\n",
      "courtyard. There, they found two women; one, knitting.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Madame Defarge, surely!” said Mr. Lorry, who had left her in exactly\n",
      "the same attitude some seventeen years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is she,” observed her husband.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Does Madame go with us?” inquired Mr. Lorry, seeing that she moved as\n",
      "they moved.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. That she may be able to recognise the faces and know the persons.\n",
      "It is for their safety.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Beginning to be struck by Defarge’s manner, Mr. Lorry looked dubiously\n",
      "at him, and led the way. Both the women followed; the second woman being\n",
      "The Vengeance.\n",
      "\n",
      "They passed through the intervening streets as quickly as they might,\n",
      "ascended the staircase of the new domicile, were admitted by Jerry,\n",
      "and found Lucie weeping, alone. She was thrown into a transport by the\n",
      "tidings Mr. Lorry gave her of her husband, and clasped the hand that\n",
      "delivered his note--little thinking what it had been doing near him in\n",
      "the night, and might, but for a chance, have done to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "     “DEAREST,--Take courage.  I am well, and your father has\n",
      "      influence around me.  You cannot answer this.\n",
      "      Kiss our child for me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That was all the writing. It was so much, however, to her who received\n",
      "it, that she turned from Defarge to his wife, and kissed one of the\n",
      "hands that knitted. It was a passionate, loving, thankful, womanly\n",
      "action, but the hand made no response--dropped cold and heavy, and took\n",
      "to its knitting again.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was something in its touch that gave Lucie a check. She stopped in\n",
      "the act of putting the note in her bosom, and, with her hands yet at her\n",
      "neck, looked terrified at Madame Defarge. Madame Defarge met the lifted\n",
      "eyebrows and forehead with a cold, impassive stare.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear,” said Mr. Lorry, striking in to explain; “there are frequent\n",
      "risings in the streets; and, although it is not likely they will ever\n",
      "trouble you, Madame Defarge wishes to see those whom she has the power\n",
      "to protect at such times, to the end that she may know them--that she\n",
      "may identify them. I believe,” said Mr. Lorry, rather halting in his\n",
      "reassuring words, as the stony manner of all the three impressed itself\n",
      "upon him more and more, “I state the case, Citizen Defarge?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Defarge looked gloomily at his wife, and gave no other answer than a\n",
      "gruff sound of acquiescence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You had better, Lucie,” said Mr. Lorry, doing all he could to\n",
      "propitiate, by tone and manner, “have the dear child here, and our\n",
      "good Pross. Our good Pross, Defarge, is an English lady, and knows no\n",
      "French.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The lady in question, whose rooted conviction that she was more than a\n",
      "match for any foreigner, was not to be shaken by distress and, danger,\n",
      "appeared with folded arms, and observed in English to The Vengeance,\n",
      "whom her eyes first encountered, “Well, I am sure, Boldface! I hope\n",
      "_you_ are pretty well!” She also bestowed a British cough on Madame\n",
      "Defarge; but, neither of the two took much heed of her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is that his child?” said Madame Defarge, stopping in her work for the\n",
      "first time, and pointing her knitting-needle at little Lucie as if it\n",
      "were the finger of Fate.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, madame,” answered Mr. Lorry; “this is our poor prisoner’s darling\n",
      "daughter, and only child.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed to fall so\n",
      "threatening and dark on the child, that her mother instinctively\n",
      "kneeled on the ground beside her, and held her to her breast. The\n",
      "shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed then to fall,\n",
      "threatening and dark, on both the mother and the child.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is enough, my husband,” said Madame Defarge. “I have seen them. We\n",
      "may go.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But, the suppressed manner had enough of menace in it--not visible and\n",
      "presented, but indistinct and withheld--to alarm Lucie into saying, as\n",
      "she laid her appealing hand on Madame Defarge’s dress:\n",
      "\n",
      "“You will be good to my poor husband. You will do him no harm. You will\n",
      "help me to see him if you can?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your husband is not my business here,” returned Madame Defarge, looking\n",
      "down at her with perfect composure. “It is the daughter of your father\n",
      "who is my business here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“For my sake, then, be merciful to my husband. For my child’s sake! She\n",
      "will put her hands together and pray you to be merciful. We are more\n",
      "afraid of you than of these others.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Defarge received it as a compliment, and looked at her husband.\n",
      "Defarge, who had been uneasily biting his thumb-nail and looking at her,\n",
      "collected his face into a sterner expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is it that your husband says in that little letter?” asked Madame\n",
      "Defarge, with a lowering smile. “Influence; he says something touching\n",
      "influence?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That my father,” said Lucie, hurriedly taking the paper from her\n",
      "breast, but with her alarmed eyes on her questioner and not on it, “has\n",
      "much influence around him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Surely it will release him!” said Madame Defarge. “Let it do so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“As a wife and mother,” cried Lucie, most earnestly, “I implore you to\n",
      "have pity on me and not to exercise any power that you possess, against\n",
      "my innocent husband, but to use it in his behalf. O sister-woman, think\n",
      "of me. As a wife and mother!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Defarge looked, coldly as ever, at the suppliant, and said,\n",
      "turning to her friend The Vengeance:\n",
      "\n",
      "“The wives and mothers we have been used to see, since we were as little\n",
      "as this child, and much less, have not been greatly considered? We have\n",
      "known _their_ husbands and fathers laid in prison and kept from them,\n",
      "often enough? All our lives, we have seen our sister-women suffer, in\n",
      "themselves and in their children, poverty, nakedness, hunger, thirst,\n",
      "sickness, misery, oppression and neglect of all kinds?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We have seen nothing else,” returned The Vengeance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We have borne this a long time,” said Madame Defarge, turning her eyes\n",
      "again upon Lucie. “Judge you! Is it likely that the trouble of one wife\n",
      "and mother would be much to us now?”\n",
      "\n",
      "She resumed her knitting and went out. The Vengeance followed. Defarge\n",
      "went last, and closed the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Courage, my dear Lucie,” said Mr. Lorry, as he raised her. “Courage,\n",
      "courage! So far all goes well with us--much, much better than it has of\n",
      "late gone with many poor souls. Cheer up, and have a thankful heart.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am not thankless, I hope, but that dreadful woman seems to throw a\n",
      "shadow on me and on all my hopes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tut, tut!” said Mr. Lorry; “what is this despondency in the brave\n",
      "little breast? A shadow indeed! No substance in it, Lucie.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But the shadow of the manner of these Defarges was dark upon himself,\n",

      "CHAPTER IV.\n",
      "Calm in Storm\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Doctor Manette did not return until the morning of the fourth day of his\n",
      "absence. So much of what had happened in that dreadful time as could be\n",
      "kept from the knowledge of Lucie was so well concealed from her, that\n",
      "not until long afterwards, when France and she were far apart, did she\n",
      "know that eleven hundred defenceless prisoners of both sexes and all\n",
      "ages had been killed by the populace; that four days and nights had been\n",
      "darkened by this deed of horror; and that the air around her had been\n",
      "tainted by the slain. She only knew that there had been an attack upon\n",
      "the prisons, that all political prisoners had been in danger, and that\n",
      "some had been dragged out by the crowd and murdered.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Mr. Lorry, the Doctor communicated under an injunction of secrecy on\n",
      "which he had no need to dwell, that the crowd had taken him through a\n",
      "scene of carnage to the prison of La Force. That, in the prison he had\n",
      "found a self-appointed Tribunal sitting, before which the prisoners were\n",
      "brought singly, and by which they were rapidly ordered to be put forth\n",
      "to be massacred, or to be released, or (in a few cases) to be sent back\n",
      "to their cells. That, presented by his conductors to this Tribunal, he\n",
      "had announced himself by name and profession as having been for eighteen\n",
      "years a secret and unaccused prisoner in the Bastille; that, one of the\n",
      "body so sitting in judgment had risen and identified him, and that this\n",
      "man was Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "That, hereupon he had ascertained, through the registers on the table,\n",
      "that his son-in-law was among the living prisoners, and had pleaded hard\n",
      "to the Tribunal--of whom some members were asleep and some awake, some\n",
      "dirty with murder and some clean, some sober and some not--for his life\n",
      "and liberty. That, in the first frantic greetings lavished on himself as\n",
      "a notable sufferer under the overthrown system, it had been accorded\n",
      "to him to have Charles Darnay brought before the lawless Court, and\n",
      "examined. That, he seemed on the point of being at once released, when\n",
      "the tide in his favour met with some unexplained check (not intelligible\n",
      "to the Doctor), which led to a few words of secret conference. That,\n",
      "the man sitting as President had then informed Doctor Manette that\n",
      "the prisoner must remain in custody, but should, for his sake, be held\n",
      "inviolate in safe custody. That, immediately, on a signal, the prisoner\n",
      "was removed to the interior of the prison again; but, that he, the\n",
      "Doctor, had then so strongly pleaded for permission to remain and\n",
      "assure himself that his son-in-law was, through no malice or mischance,\n",
      "delivered to the concourse whose murderous yells outside the gate had\n",
      "often drowned the proceedings, that he had obtained the permission, and\n",
      "had remained in that Hall of Blood until the danger was over.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sights he had seen there, with brief snatches of food and sleep by\n",
      "intervals, shall remain untold. The mad joy over the prisoners who were\n",
      "saved, had astounded him scarcely less than the mad ferocity against\n",
      "those who were cut to pieces. One prisoner there was, he said, who had\n",
      "been discharged into the street free, but at whom a mistaken savage had\n",
      "thrust a pike as he passed out. Being besought to go to him and dress\n",
      "the wound, the Doctor had passed out at the same gate, and had found him\n",
      "in the arms of a company of Samaritans, who were seated on the bodies\n",
      "of their victims. With an inconsistency as monstrous as anything in this\n",
      "awful nightmare, they had helped the healer, and tended the wounded man\n",
      "with the gentlest solicitude--had made a litter for him and escorted him\n",
      "carefully from the spot--had then caught up their weapons and plunged\n",
      "anew into a butchery so dreadful, that the Doctor had covered his eyes\n",
      "with his hands, and swooned away in the midst of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Mr. Lorry received these confidences, and as he watched the face of\n",
      "his friend now sixty-two years of age, a misgiving arose within him that\n",
      "such dread experiences would revive the old danger.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, he had never seen his friend in his present aspect: he had never\n",
      "at all known him in his present character. For the first time the Doctor\n",
      "felt, now, that his suffering was strength and power. For the first time\n",
      "he felt that in that sharp fire, he had slowly forged the iron which\n",
      "could break the prison door of his daughter’s husband, and deliver him.\n",
      "“It all tended to a good end, my friend; it was not mere waste and ruin.\n",
      "As my beloved child was helpful in restoring me to myself, I will be\n",
      "helpful now in restoring the dearest part of herself to her; by the aid\n",
      "of Heaven I will do it!” Thus, Doctor Manette. And when Jarvis Lorry saw\n",
      "the kindled eyes, the resolute face, the calm strong look and bearing\n",
      "of the man whose life always seemed to him to have been stopped, like a\n",
      "clock, for so many years, and then set going again with an energy which\n",
      "had lain dormant during the cessation of its usefulness, he believed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Greater things than the Doctor had at that time to contend with, would\n",
      "have yielded before his persevering purpose. While he kept himself\n",
      "in his place, as a physician, whose business was with all degrees\n",
      "of mankind, bond and free, rich and poor, bad and good, he used his\n",
      "personal influence so wisely, that he was soon the inspecting physician\n",
      "of three prisons, and among them of La Force. He could now assure Lucie\n",
      "that her husband was no longer confined alone, but was mixed with the\n",
      "general body of prisoners; he saw her husband weekly, and brought sweet\n",
      "messages to her, straight from his lips; sometimes her husband himself\n",
      "sent a letter to her (though never by the Doctor’s hand), but she was\n",
      "not permitted to write to him: for, among the many wild suspicions of\n",
      "plots in the prisons, the wildest of all pointed at emigrants who were\n",
      "known to have made friends or permanent connections abroad.\n",
      "\n",
      "This new life of the Doctor’s was an anxious life, no doubt; still, the\n",
      "sagacious Mr. Lorry saw that there was a new sustaining pride in it.\n",
      "Nothing unbecoming tinged the pride; it was a natural and worthy one;\n",
      "but he observed it as a curiosity. The Doctor knew, that up to that\n",
      "time, his imprisonment had been associated in the minds of his daughter\n",
      "and his friend, with his personal affliction, deprivation, and weakness.\n",
      "Now that this was changed, and he knew himself to be invested through\n",
      "that old trial with forces to which they both looked for Charles’s\n",
      "ultimate safety and deliverance, he became so far exalted by the change,\n",
      "that he took the lead and direction, and required them as the weak, to\n",
      "trust to him as the strong. The preceding relative positions of himself\n",
      "and Lucie were reversed, yet only as the liveliest gratitude and\n",
      "affection could reverse them, for he could have had no pride but in\n",
      "rendering some service to her who had rendered so much to him. “All\n",
      "curious to see,” thought Mr. Lorry, in his amiably shrewd way, “but all\n",
      "natural and right; so, take the lead, my dear friend, and keep it; it\n",
      "couldn’t be in better hands.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But, though the Doctor tried hard, and never ceased trying, to get\n",
      "Charles Darnay set at liberty, or at least to get him brought to trial,\n",
      "the public current of the time set too strong and fast for him. The new\n",
      "era began; the king was tried, doomed, and beheaded; the Republic of\n",
      "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, declared for victory or death\n",
      "against the world in arms; the black flag waved night and day from the\n",
      "great towers of Notre Dame; three hundred thousand men, summoned to rise\n",
      "against the tyrants of the earth, rose from all the varying soils\n",
      "of France, as if the dragon’s teeth had been sown broadcast, and\n",
      "had yielded fruit equally on hill and plain, on rock, in gravel, and\n",
      "alluvial mud, under the bright sky of the South and under the clouds of\n",
      "the North, in fell and forest, in the vineyards and the olive-grounds\n",
      "and among the cropped grass and the stubble of the corn, along the\n",
      "fruitful banks of the broad rivers, and in the sand of the sea-shore.\n",
      "What private solicitude could rear itself against the deluge of the Year\n",
      "One of Liberty--the deluge rising from below, not falling from above,\n",
      "and with the windows of Heaven shut, not opened!\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no pause, no pity, no peace, no interval of relenting rest, no\n",
      "measurement of time. Though days and nights circled as regularly as when\n",
      "time was young, and the evening and morning were the first day, other\n",
      "count of time there was none. Hold of it was lost in the raging fever\n",
      "of a nation, as it is in the fever of one patient. Now, breaking the\n",
      "unnatural silence of a whole city, the executioner showed the people the\n",
      "head of the king--and now, it seemed almost in the same breath, the\n",
      "head of his fair wife which had had eight weary months of imprisoned\n",
      "widowhood and misery, to turn it grey.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yet, observing the strange law of contradiction which obtains in\n",
      "all such cases, the time was long, while it flamed by so fast. A\n",
      "revolutionary tribunal in the capital, and forty or fifty thousand\n",
      "revolutionary committees all over the land; a law of the Suspected,\n",
      "which struck away all security for liberty or life, and delivered over\n",
      "any good and innocent person to any bad and guilty one; prisons gorged\n",
      "with people who had committed no offence, and could obtain no hearing;\n",
      "these things became the established order and nature of appointed\n",
      "things, and seemed to be ancient usage before they were many weeks old.\n",
      "Above all, one hideous figure grew as familiar as if it had been before\n",
      "the general gaze from the foundations of the world--the figure of the\n",
      "sharp female called La Guillotine.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the popular theme for jests; it was the best cure for headache,\n",
      "it infallibly prevented the hair from turning grey, it imparted a\n",
      "peculiar delicacy to the complexion, it was the National Razor which\n",
      "shaved close: who kissed La Guillotine, looked through the little window\n",
      "and sneezed into the sack. It was the sign of the regeneration of the\n",
      "human race. It superseded the Cross. Models of it were worn on breasts\n",
      "from which the Cross was discarded, and it was bowed down to and\n",
      "believed in where the Cross was denied.\n",
      "\n",
      "It sheared off heads so many, that it, and the ground it most polluted,\n",
      "were a rotten red. It was taken to pieces, like a toy-puzzle for a young\n",
      "Devil, and was put together again when the occasion wanted it. It hushed\n",
      "the eloquent, struck down the powerful, abolished the beautiful and\n",
      "good. Twenty-two friends of high public mark, twenty-one living and one\n",
      "dead, it had lopped the heads off, in one morning, in as many minutes.\n",
      "The name of the strong man of Old Scripture had descended to the chief\n",
      "functionary who worked it; but, so armed, he was stronger than his\n",
      "namesake, and blinder, and tore away the gates of God’s own Temple every\n",
      "day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among these terrors, and the brood belonging to them, the Doctor walked\n",
      "with a steady head: confident in his power, cautiously persistent in his\n",
      "end, never doubting that he would save Lucie’s husband at last. Yet the\n",
      "current of the time swept by, so strong and deep, and carried the time\n",
      "away so fiercely, that Charles had lain in prison one year and three\n",
      "months when the Doctor was thus steady and confident. So much more\n",
      "wicked and distracted had the Revolution grown in that December month,\n",
      "that the rivers of the South were encumbered with the bodies of the\n",
      "violently drowned by night, and prisoners were shot in lines and squares\n",
      "under the southern wintry sun. Still, the Doctor walked among the\n",
      "terrors with a steady head. No man better known than he, in Paris at\n",
      "that day; no man in a stranger situation. Silent, humane, indispensable\n",
      "in hospital and prison, using his art equally among assassins and\n",
      "victims, he was a man apart. In the exercise of his skill, the\n",
      "appearance and the story of the Bastille Captive removed him from all\n",
      "other men. He was not suspected or brought in question, any more than if\n",

      "of the public way, and, with their heads low down and their hands high\n",
      "up, swooped screaming off. No fight could have been half so terrible\n",
      "as this dance. It was so emphatically a fallen sport--a something, once\n",
      "innocent, delivered over to all devilry--a healthy pastime changed into\n",
      "a means of angering the blood, bewildering the senses, and steeling the\n",

      "The dread tribunal of five Judges, Public Prosecutor, and determined\n",

      "\n",
      "“Charles Evrémonde, called Darnay!”\n",
      "\n",

      "When a name was called, its owner stepped apart into a spot reserved\n",

      "His bloated gaoler, who wore spectacles to read with, glanced over them\n",
      "to assure himself that he had taken his place, and went through the\n",
      "list, making a similar short pause at each name. There were twenty-three\n",
      "names, but only twenty were responded to; for one of the prisoners so\n",
      "summoned had died in gaol and been forgotten, and two had already been\n",
      "guillotined and forgotten. The list was read, in the vaulted chamber\n",
      "where Darnay had seen the associated prisoners on the night of his\n",
      "arrival. Every one of those had perished in the massacre; every human\n",
      "creature he had since cared for and parted with, had died on the\n",

      "There were hurried words of farewell and kindness, but the parting was\n",

      "concert, for that evening. They crowded to the grates and shed tears\n",
      "there; but, twenty places in the projected entertainments had to be\n",
      "refilled, and the time was, at best, short to the lock-up hour, when the\n",
      "common rooms and corridors would be delivered over to the great dogs\n",
      "who kept watch there through the night. The prisoners were far from\n",
      "insensible or unfeeling; their ways arose out of the condition of the\n",
      "time. Similarly, though with a subtle difference, a species of fervour\n",
      "or intoxication, known, without doubt, to have led some persons to\n",
      "brave the guillotine unnecessarily, and to die by it, was not mere\n",
      "boastfulness, but a wild infection of the wildly shaken public mind. In\n",

      "usual order of things was reversed, and that the felons were trying the\n",
      "honest men. The lowest, cruelest, and worst populace of a city, never\n",

      "in the two figures was, that although they were posted as close to\n",
      "himself as they could be, they never looked towards him. They seemed to\n",
      "be waiting for something with a dogged determination, and they looked at\n",

      "he lived by giving instruction in the French language and literature.\n",
      "He had returned when he did, on the pressing and written entreaty of\n",
      "a French citizen, who represented that his life was endangered by his\n",
      "absence. He had come back, to save a citizen’s life, and to bear his\n",

      "circumstances into view, with the greatest discretion and with the\n",
      "straightforward force of truth and earnestness, the Jury and the\n",
      "populace became one. At last, when he appealed by name to Monsieur\n",
      "Lorry, an English gentleman then and there present, who, like himself,\n",
      "had been a witness on that English trial and could corroborate his\n",
      "account of it, the Jury declared that they had heard enough, and that\n",

      "their swollen account of cruel rage. No man can decide now to which of\n",
      "these motives such extraordinary scenes were referable; it is probable,\n",
      "to a blending of all the three, with the second predominating. No sooner\n",

      "at another time, and such fraternal embraces were bestowed upon the\n",
      "prisoner by as many of both sexes as could rush at him, that after\n",
      "his long and unwholesome confinement he was in danger of fainting from\n",
      "exhaustion; none the less because he knew very well, that the very same\n",
      "people, carried by another current, would have rushed at him with\n",
      "the very same intensity, to rend him to pieces and strew him over the\n",

      "\n",
      "His removal, to make way for other accused persons who were to be tried,\n",
      "rescued him from these caresses for the moment. Five were to be tried\n",
      "together, next, as enemies of the Republic, forasmuch as they had not\n",
      "assisted it by word or deed. So quick was the Tribunal to compensate\n",
      "itself and the nation for a chance lost, that these five came down to\n",
      "him before he left the place, condemned to die within twenty-four\n",
      "hours. The first of them told him so, with the customary prison sign\n",

      "concourse made at him anew, weeping, embracing, and shouting, all by\n",
      "turns and all together, until the very tide of the river on the bank of\n",

      "they had reddened them below the snow with a deeper dye, they carried\n",
      "him thus into the courtyard of the building where he lived. Her father\n",
      "had gone on before, to prepare her, and when her husband stood upon his\n",

      "As he held her to his heart and turned her beautiful head between his\n",
      "face and the brawling crowd, so that his tears and her lips might come\n",
      "together unseen, a few of the people fell to dancing. Instantly, all the\n",
      "rest fell to dancing, and the courtyard overflowed with the Carmagnole.\n",
      "Then, they elevated into the vacant chair a young woman from the\n",
      "crowd to be carried as the Goddess of Liberty, and then swelling and\n",
      "overflowing out into the adjacent streets, and along the river’s bank,\n",

      "vague but heavy fear was upon her.\n",
      "\n",
      "All the air round was so thick and dark, the people were so passionately\n",
      "revengeful and fitful, the innocent were so constantly put to death on\n",
      "vague suspicion and black malice, it was so impossible to forget that\n",
      "many as blameless as her husband and as dear to others as he was to\n",
      "her, every day shared the fate from which he had been clutched, that her\n",

      "The shadows of the wintry afternoon were beginning to fall, and even now\n",
      "the dreadful carts were rolling through the streets. Her mind pursued\n",
      "them, looking for him among the Condemned; and then she clung closer to\n",
      "his real presence and trembled more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her father, cheering her, showed a compassionate superiority to this\n",
      "woman’s weakness, which was wonderful to see. No garret, no shoemaking,\n",
      "no One Hundred and Five, North Tower, now! He had accomplished the task\n",
      "he had set himself, his promise was redeemed, he had saved Charles. Let\n",

      "Their housekeeping was of a very frugal kind: not only because that was\n",
      "the safest way of life, involving the least offence to the people, but\n",
      "because they were not rich, and Charles, throughout his imprisonment,\n",
      "had had to pay heavily for his bad food, and for his guard, and towards\n",
      "the living of the poorer prisoners. Partly on this account, and\n",
      "partly to avoid a domestic spy, they kept no servant; the citizen and\n",
      "citizeness who acted as porters at the courtyard gate, rendered them\n",
      "occasional service; and Jerry (almost wholly transferred to them by\n",
      "Mr. Lorry) had become their daily retainer, and had his bed there every\n",
      "night.\n",

      "It was an ordinance of the Republic One and Indivisible of Liberty,\n",

      "house, the name of every inmate must be legibly inscribed in letters\n",
      "of a certain size, at a certain convenient height from the ground. Mr.\n",
      "Jerry Cruncher’s name, therefore, duly embellished the doorpost down\n",
      "below; and, as the afternoon shadows deepened, the owner of that name\n",
      "himself appeared, from overlooking a painter whom Doctor Manette had\n",
      "employed to add to the list the name of Charles Evrémonde, called\n",
      "Darnay.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the universal fear and distrust that darkened the time, all the usual\n",
      "harmless ways of life were changed. In the Doctor’s little household, as\n",
      "in very many others, the articles of daily consumption that were wanted\n",
      "were purchased every evening, in small quantities and at various small\n",
      "shops. To avoid attracting notice, and to give as little occasion as\n",
      "possible for talk and envy, was the general desire.\n",
      "\n",
      "For some months past, Miss Pross and Mr. Cruncher had discharged the\n",
      "office of purveyors; the former carrying the money; the latter, the\n",
      "basket. Every afternoon at about the time when the public lamps were\n",
      "lighted, they fared forth on this duty, and made and brought home\n",
      "such purchases as were needful. Although Miss Pross, through her long\n",
      "association with a French family, might have known as much of their\n",
      "language as of her own, if she had had a mind, she had no mind in that\n",
      "direction; consequently she knew no more of that “nonsense” (as she was\n",
      "pleased to call it) than Mr. Cruncher did. So her manner of marketing\n",
      "was to plump a noun-substantive at the head of a shopkeeper without any\n",
      "introduction in the nature of an article, and, if it happened not to be\n",
      "the name of the thing she wanted, to look round for that thing, lay hold\n",
      "of it, and hold on by it until the bargain was concluded. She always\n",
      "made a bargain for it, by holding up, as a statement of its just price,\n",
      "one finger less than the merchant held up, whatever his number might be.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, Mr. Cruncher,” said Miss Pross, whose eyes were red with felicity;\n",
      "“if you are ready, I am.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Jerry hoarsely professed himself at Miss Pross’s service. He had worn\n",
      "all his rust off long ago, but nothing would file his spiky head down.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s all manner of things wanted,” said Miss Pross, “and we shall\n",
      "have a precious time of it. We want wine, among the rest. Nice toasts\n",
      "these Redheads will be drinking, wherever we buy it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It will be much the same to your knowledge, miss, I should think,”\n",

      "\n",
      "“Who’s he?” said Miss Pross.\n",

      "Mr. Cruncher, with some diffidence, explained himself as meaning “Old\n",
      "Nick’s.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ha!” said Miss Pross, “it doesn’t need an interpreter to explain the\n",
      "meaning of these creatures. They have but one, and it’s Midnight Murder,\n",
      "and Mischief.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hush, dear! Pray, pray, be cautious!” cried Lucie.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, yes, yes, I’ll be cautious,” said Miss Pross; “but I may say\n",
      "among ourselves, that I do hope there will be no oniony and tobaccoey\n",
      "smotherings in the form of embracings all round, going on in the\n",
      "streets. Now, Ladybird, never you stir from that fire till I come back!\n",
      "Take care of the dear husband you have recovered, and don’t move your\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“For gracious sake, don’t talk about Liberty; we have quite enough of\n",
      "that,” said Miss Pross.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hush, dear! Again?” Lucie remonstrated.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, my sweet,” said Miss Pross, nodding her head emphatically, “the\n",
      "short and the long of it is, that I am a subject of His Most Gracious\n",
      "Majesty King George the Third;” Miss Pross curtseyed at the name; “and\n",

      "way to affect to make light of anything that was a great anxiety\n",
      "with them all, and to come at it in this chance manner--“is there any\n",
      "prospect yet, of our getting out of this place?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I fear not yet. It would be dangerous for Charles yet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Heigh-ho-hum!” said Miss Pross, cheerfully repressing a sigh as she\n",
      "glanced at her darling’s golden hair in the light of the fire, “then we\n",
      "must have patience and wait: that’s all. We must hold up our heads and\n",
      "fight low, as my brother Solomon used to say. Now, Mr. Cruncher!--Don’t\n",
      "you move, Ladybird!”\n",
      "\n",
      "They went out, leaving Lucie, and her husband, her father, and the\n",
      "child, by a bright fire. Mr. Lorry was expected back presently from the\n",
      "Banking House. Miss Pross had lighted the lamp, but had put it aside in\n",
      "a corner, that they might enjoy the fire-light undisturbed. Little Lucie\n",
      "sat by her grandfather with her hands clasped through his arm: and he,\n",
      "in a tone not rising much above a whisper, began to tell her a story of\n",
      "a great and powerful Fairy who had opened a prison-wall and let out\n",
      "a captive who had once done the Fairy a service. All was subdued and\n",
      "quiet, and Lucie was more at ease than she had been.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is that?” she cried, all at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear!” said her father, stopping in his story, and laying his hand\n",
      "on hers, “command yourself. What a disordered state you are in! The\n",
      "least thing--nothing--startles you! _You_, your father’s daughter!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thought, my father,” said Lucie, excusing herself, with a pale face\n",
      "and in a faltering voice, “that I heard strange feet upon the stairs.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My love, the staircase is as still as Death.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As he said the word, a blow was struck upon the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh father, father. What can this be! Hide Charles. Save him!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My child,” said the Doctor, rising, and laying his hand upon her\n",

      "to the door.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He took the lamp in his hand, crossed the two intervening outer rooms,\n",

      "Happily unconscious of the new calamity at home, Miss Pross threaded her\n",
      "way along the narrow streets and crossed the river by the bridge of the\n",
      "Pont-Neuf, reckoning in her mind the number of indispensable purchases\n",
      "she had to make. Mr. Cruncher, with the basket, walked at her side. They\n",
      "both looked to the right and to the left into most of the shops they\n",
      "passed, had a wary eye for all gregarious assemblages of people, and\n",
      "turned out of their road to avoid any very excited group of talkers. It\n",
      "was a raw evening, and the misty river, blurred to the eye with blazing\n",
      "lights and to the ear with harsh noises, showed where the barges were\n",
      "stationed in which the smiths worked, making guns for the Army of the\n",
      "Republic. Woe to the man who played tricks with _that_ Army, or got\n",
      "undeserved promotion in it! Better for him that his beard had never\n",
      "grown, for the National Razor shaved him close.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having purchased a few small articles of grocery, and a measure of oil\n",
      "for the lamp, Miss Pross bethought herself of the wine they wanted.\n",
      "After peeping into several wine-shops, she stopped at the sign of the\n",
      "Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, not far from the National Palace,\n",
      "once (and twice) the Tuileries, where the aspect of things rather\n",
      "took her fancy. It had a quieter look than any other place of the same\n",
      "description they had passed, and, though red with patriotic caps, was\n",
      "not so red as the rest. Sounding Mr. Cruncher, and finding him of her\n",
      "opinion, Miss Pross resorted to the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity,\n",
      "attended by her cavalier.\n",
      "\n",
      "Slightly observant of the smoky lights; of the people, pipe in mouth,\n",
      "playing with limp cards and yellow dominoes; of the one bare-breasted,\n",
      "bare-armed, soot-begrimed workman reading a journal aloud, and of\n",
      "the others listening to him; of the weapons worn, or laid aside to be\n",
      "resumed; of the two or three customers fallen forward asleep, who in the\n",
      "popular high-shouldered shaggy black spencer looked, in that attitude,\n",
      "like slumbering bears or dogs; the two outlandish customers approached\n",
      "the counter, and showed what they wanted.\n",
      "\n",
      "As their wine was measuring out, a man parted from another man in a\n",
      "corner, and rose to depart. In going, he had to face Miss Pross. No\n",
      "sooner did he face her, than Miss Pross uttered a scream, and clapped\n",
      "her hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a moment, the whole company were on their feet. That somebody was\n",
      "assassinated by somebody vindicating a difference of opinion was the\n",
      "likeliest occurrence. Everybody looked to see somebody fall, but only\n",
      "saw a man and a woman standing staring at each other; the man with all\n",
      "the outward aspect of a Frenchman and a thorough Republican; the woman,\n",
      "evidently English.\n",
      "\n",
      "What was said in this disappointing anti-climax, by the disciples of the\n",
      "Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, except that it was something very\n",
      "voluble and loud, would have been as so much Hebrew or Chaldean to Miss\n",
      "Pross and her protector, though they had been all ears. But, they had no\n",
      "ears for anything in their surprise. For, it must be recorded, that\n",
      "not only was Miss Pross lost in amazement and agitation, but,\n",
      "Mr. Cruncher--though it seemed on his own separate and individual\n",
      "account--was in a state of the greatest wonder.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is the matter?” said the man who had caused Miss Pross to scream;\n",
      "speaking in a vexed, abrupt voice (though in a low tone), and in\n",
      "English.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, Solomon, dear Solomon!” cried Miss Pross, clapping her hands again.\n",
      "“After not setting eyes upon you or hearing of you for so long a time,\n",
      "do I find you here!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t call me Solomon. Do you want to be the death of me?” asked the\n",
      "man, in a furtive, frightened way.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Brother, brother!” cried Miss Pross, bursting into tears. “Have I ever\n",
      "been so hard with you that you ask me such a cruel question?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then hold your meddlesome tongue,” said Solomon, “and come out, if you\n",
      "want to speak to me. Pay for your wine, and come out. Who’s this man?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Pross, shaking her loving and dejected head at her by no means\n",
      "affectionate brother, said through her tears, “Mr. Cruncher.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let him come out too,” said Solomon. “Does he think me a ghost?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Apparently, Mr. Cruncher did, to judge from his looks. He said not a\n",
      "word, however, and Miss Pross, exploring the depths of her reticule\n",
      "through her tears with great difficulty paid for her wine. As she did\n",
      "so, Solomon turned to the followers of the Good Republican Brutus\n",
      "of Antiquity, and offered a few words of explanation in the French\n",
      "language, which caused them all to relapse into their former places and\n",
      "pursuits.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now,” said Solomon, stopping at the dark street corner, “what do you\n",
      "want?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How dreadfully unkind in a brother nothing has ever turned my love away\n",
      "from!” cried Miss Pross, “to give me such a greeting, and show me no\n",
      "affection.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There. Confound it! There,” said Solomon, making a dab at Miss Pross’s\n",
      "lips with his own. “Now are you content?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Pross only shook her head and wept in silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you expect me to be surprised,” said her brother Solomon, “I am not\n",
      "surprised; I knew you were here; I know of most people who are here. If\n",
      "you really don’t want to endanger my existence--which I half believe you\n",
      "do--go your ways as soon as possible, and let me go mine. I am busy. I\n",
      "am an official.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My English brother Solomon,” mourned Miss Pross, casting up her\n",
      "tear-fraught eyes, “that had the makings in him of one of the best and\n",
      "greatest of men in his native country, an official among foreigners, and\n",
      "such foreigners! I would almost sooner have seen the dear boy lying in\n",
      "his--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I said so!” cried her brother, interrupting. “I knew it. You want to be\n",
      "the death of me. I shall be rendered Suspected, by my own sister. Just\n",
      "as I am getting on!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The gracious and merciful Heavens forbid!” cried Miss Pross. “Far\n",
      "rather would I never see you again, dear Solomon, though I have ever\n",
      "loved you truly, and ever shall. Say but one affectionate word to me,\n",
      "and tell me there is nothing angry or estranged between us, and I will\n",
      "detain you no longer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Good Miss Pross! As if the estrangement between them had come of any\n",
      "culpability of hers. As if Mr. Lorry had not known it for a fact, years\n",
      "ago, in the quiet corner in Soho, that this precious brother had spent\n",
      "her money and left her!\n",
      "\n",
      "He was saying the affectionate word, however, with a far more grudging\n",
      "condescension and patronage than he could have shown if their relative\n",
      "merits and positions had been reversed (which is invariably the case,\n",
      "all the world over), when Mr. Cruncher, touching him on the shoulder,\n",
      "hoarsely and unexpectedly interposed with the following singular\n",
      "question:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I say! Might I ask the favour? As to whether your name is John Solomon,\n",
      "or Solomon John?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The official turned towards him with sudden distrust. He had not\n",
      "previously uttered a word.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come!” said Mr. Cruncher. “Speak out, you know.” (Which, by the way,\n",
      "was more than he could do himself.) “John Solomon, or Solomon John? She\n",
      "calls you Solomon, and she must know, being your sister. And _I_ know\n",
      "you’re John, you know. Which of the two goes first? And regarding that\n",
      "name of Pross, likewise. That warn’t your name over the water.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you mean?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I don’t know all I mean, for I can’t call to mind what your name\n",
      "was, over the water.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No. But I’ll swear it was a name of two syllables.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. T’other one’s was one syllable. I know you. You was a spy--witness\n",
      "at the Bailey. What, in the name of the Father of Lies, own father to\n",
      "yourself, was you called at that time?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Barsad,” said another voice, striking in.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s the name for a thousand pound!” cried Jerry.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker who struck in, was Sydney Carton. He had his hands behind\n",
      "him under the skirts of his riding-coat, and he stood at Mr. Cruncher’s\n",
      "elbow as negligently as he might have stood at the Old Bailey itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t be alarmed, my dear Miss Pross. I arrived at Mr. Lorry’s, to his\n",
      "surprise, yesterday evening; we agreed that I would not present myself\n",
      "elsewhere until all was well, or unless I could be useful; I present\n",
      "myself here, to beg a little talk with your brother. I wish you had a\n",
      "better employed brother than Mr. Barsad. I wish for your sake Mr. Barsad\n",
      "was not a Sheep of the Prisons.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sheep was a cant word of the time for a spy, under the gaolers. The spy,\n",
      "who was pale, turned paler, and asked him how he dared--\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll tell you,” said Sydney. “I lighted on you, Mr. Barsad, coming out\n",
      "of the prison of the Conciergerie while I was contemplating the walls,\n",
      "an hour or more ago. You have a face to be remembered, and I remember\n",
      "faces well. Made curious by seeing you in that connection, and having\n",
      "a reason, to which you are no stranger, for associating you with\n",
      "the misfortunes of a friend now very unfortunate, I walked in your\n",
      "direction. I walked into the wine-shop here, close after you, and\n",
      "sat near you. I had no difficulty in deducing from your unreserved\n",
      "conversation, and the rumour openly going about among your admirers, the\n",
      "nature of your calling. And gradually, what I had done at random, seemed\n",
      "to shape itself into a purpose, Mr. Barsad.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What purpose?” the spy asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It would be troublesome, and might be dangerous, to explain in the\n",
      "street. Could you favour me, in confidence, with some minutes of your\n",
      "company--at the office of Tellson’s Bank, for instance?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Under a threat?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! Did I say that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then, why should I go there?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Really, Mr. Barsad, I can’t say, if you can’t.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you mean that you won’t say, sir?” the spy irresolutely asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You apprehend me very clearly, Mr. Barsad. I won’t.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Carton’s negligent recklessness of manner came powerfully in aid of his\n",
      "quickness and skill, in such a business as he had in his secret mind,\n",
      "and with such a man as he had to do with. His practised eye saw it, and\n",
      "made the most of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, I told you so,” said the spy, casting a reproachful look at his\n",
      "sister; “if any trouble comes of this, it’s your doing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come, come, Mr. Barsad!” exclaimed Sydney. “Don’t be ungrateful.\n",
      "But for my great respect for your sister, I might not have led up so\n",
      "pleasantly to a little proposal that I wish to make for our mutual\n",
      "satisfaction. Do you go with me to the Bank?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll hear what you have got to say. Yes, I’ll go with you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I propose that we first conduct your sister safely to the corner of her\n",
      "own street. Let me take your arm, Miss Pross. This is not a good city,\n",
      "at this time, for you to be out in, unprotected; and as your escort\n",
      "knows Mr. Barsad, I will invite him to Mr. Lorry’s with us. Are we\n",
      "ready? Come then!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Pross recalled soon afterwards, and to the end of her life\n",
      "remembered, that as she pressed her hands on Sydney’s arm and looked up\n",
      "in his face, imploring him to do no hurt to Solomon, there was a braced\n",
      "purpose in the arm and a kind of inspiration in the eyes, which not only\n",
      "contradicted his light manner, but changed and raised the man. She was\n",
      "too much occupied then with fears for the brother who so little deserved\n",
      "her affection, and with Sydney’s friendly reassurances, adequately to\n",
      "heed what she observed.\n",
      "\n",
      "They left her at the corner of the street, and Carton led the way to Mr.\n",
      "Lorry’s, which was within a few minutes’ walk. John Barsad, or Solomon\n",
      "Pross, walked at his side.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lorry had just finished his dinner, and was sitting before a cheery\n",
      "little log or two of fire--perhaps looking into their blaze for the\n",
      "picture of that younger elderly gentleman from Tellson’s, who had looked\n",
      "into the red coals at the Royal George at Dover, now a good many years\n",
      "ago. He turned his head as they entered, and showed the surprise with\n",
      "which he saw a stranger.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Pross’s brother, sir,” said Sydney. “Mr. Barsad.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Barsad?” repeated the old gentleman, “Barsad? I have an association\n",
      "with the name--and with the face.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I told you you had a remarkable face, Mr. Barsad,” observed Carton,\n",
      "coolly. “Pray sit down.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As he took a chair himself, he supplied the link that Mr. Lorry wanted,\n",
      "by saying to him with a frown, “Witness at that trial.” Mr. Lorry\n",
      "immediately remembered, and regarded his new visitor with an undisguised\n",
      "look of abhorrence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Barsad has been recognised by Miss Pross as the affectionate\n",
      "brother you have heard of,” said Sydney, “and has acknowledged the\n",
      "relationship. I pass to worse news. Darnay has been arrested again.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Struck with consternation, the old gentleman exclaimed, “What do you\n",
      "tell me! I left him safe and free within these two hours, and am about\n",
      "to return to him!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Arrested for all that. When was it done, Mr. Barsad?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Just now, if at all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Barsad is the best authority possible, sir,” said Sydney, “and I\n",
      "have it from Mr. Barsad’s communication to a friend and brother Sheep\n",
      "over a bottle of wine, that the arrest has taken place. He left the\n",
      "messengers at the gate, and saw them admitted by the porter. There is no\n",
      "earthly doubt that he is retaken.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lorry’s business eye read in the speaker’s face that it was loss\n",
      "of time to dwell upon the point. Confused, but sensible that something\n",
      "might depend on his presence of mind, he commanded himself, and was\n",
      "silently attentive.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, I trust,” said Sydney to him, “that the name and influence of\n",
      "Doctor Manette may stand him in as good stead to-morrow--you said he\n",
      "would be before the Tribunal again to-morrow, Mr. Barsad?--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes; I believe so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“--In as good stead to-morrow as to-day. But it may not be so. I own\n",
      "to you, I am shaken, Mr. Lorry, by Doctor Manette’s not having had the\n",
      "power to prevent this arrest.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He may not have known of it beforehand,” said Mr. Lorry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But that very circumstance would be alarming, when we remember how\n",
      "identified he is with his son-in-law.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s true,” Mr. Lorry acknowledged, with his troubled hand at his\n",
      "chin, and his troubled eyes on Carton.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In short,” said Sydney, “this is a desperate time, when desperate games\n",
      "are played for desperate stakes. Let the Doctor play the winning game; I\n",
      "will play the losing one. No man’s life here is worth purchase. Any one\n",
      "carried home by the people to-day, may be condemned tomorrow. Now, the\n",
      "stake I have resolved to play for, in case of the worst, is a friend\n",
      "in the Conciergerie. And the friend I purpose to myself to win, is Mr.\n",
      "Barsad.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You need have good cards, sir,” said the spy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll run them over. I’ll see what I hold,--Mr. Lorry, you know what a\n",
      "brute I am; I wish you’d give me a little brandy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was put before him, and he drank off a glassful--drank off another\n",
      "glassful--pushed the bottle thoughtfully away.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Barsad,” he went on, in the tone of one who really was looking\n",
      "over a hand at cards: “Sheep of the prisons, emissary of Republican\n",
      "committees, now turnkey, now prisoner, always spy and secret informer,\n",
      "so much the more valuable here for being English that an Englishman\n",
      "is less open to suspicion of subornation in those characters than a\n",
      "Frenchman, represents himself to his employers under a false name.\n",
      "That’s a very good card. Mr. Barsad, now in the employ of the republican\n",
      "French government, was formerly in the employ of the aristocratic\n",
      "English government, the enemy of France and freedom. That’s an excellent\n",
      "card. Inference clear as day in this region of suspicion, that Mr.\n",
      "Barsad, still in the pay of the aristocratic English government, is the\n",
      "spy of Pitt, the treacherous foe of the Republic crouching in its bosom,\n",
      "the English traitor and agent of all mischief so much spoken of and so\n",
      "difficult to find. That’s a card not to be beaten. Have you followed my\n",
      "hand, Mr. Barsad?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not to understand your play,” returned the spy, somewhat uneasily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I play my Ace, Denunciation of Mr. Barsad to the nearest Section\n",
      "Committee. Look over your hand, Mr. Barsad, and see what you have. Don’t\n",
      "hurry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He drew the bottle near, poured out another glassful of brandy, and\n",
      "drank it off. He saw that the spy was fearful of his drinking himself\n",
      "into a fit state for the immediate denunciation of him. Seeing it, he\n",
      "poured out and drank another glassful.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look over your hand carefully, Mr. Barsad. Take time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a poorer hand than he suspected. Mr. Barsad saw losing cards\n",
      "in it that Sydney Carton knew nothing of. Thrown out of his honourable\n",
      "employment in England, through too much unsuccessful hard swearing\n",
      "there--not because he was not wanted there; our English reasons for\n",
      "vaunting our superiority to secrecy and spies are of very modern\n",
      "date--he knew that he had crossed the Channel, and accepted service in\n",
      "France: first, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among his own countrymen\n",
      "there: gradually, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among the natives. He\n",
      "knew that under the overthrown government he had been a spy upon Saint\n",
      "Antoine and Defarge’s wine-shop; had received from the watchful police\n",
      "such heads of information concerning Doctor Manette’s imprisonment,\n",

      "He had since seen her, in the Section of Saint Antoine, over and over\n",
      "again produce her knitted registers, and denounce people whose lives the\n",
      "guillotine then surely swallowed up. He knew, as every one employed as\n",
      "he was did, that he was never safe; that flight was impossible; that\n",
      "he was tied fast under the shadow of the axe; and that in spite of\n",
      "his utmost tergiversation and treachery in furtherance of the reigning\n",
      "terror, a word might bring it down upon him. Once denounced, and on such\n",
      "grave grounds as had just now been suggested to his mind, he foresaw\n",
      "that the dreadful woman of whose unrelenting character he had seen many\n",
      "proofs, would produce against him that fatal register, and would quash\n",
      "his last chance of life. Besides that all secret men are men soon\n",
      "terrified, here were surely cards enough of one black suit, to justify\n",
      "the holder in growing rather livid as he turned them over.\n",

      "of which he has spoken. I admit that _I_ am a spy, and that it is\n",
      "considered a discreditable station--though it must be filled by\n",

      "received such a check from the inscrutability of Carton,--who was a\n",
      "mystery to wiser and honester men than he,--that it faltered here and\n",
      "failed him. While he was at a loss, Carton said, resuming his former air\n",
      "of contemplating cards:\n",
      "\n",
      "“And indeed, now I think again, I have a strong impression that I\n",

      "\n",
      "“No. Foreign!” cried Carton, striking his open hand on the table, as a\n",

      "me an advantage over you. Cly (who I will unreservedly admit, at this\n",
      "distance of time, was a partner of mine) has been dead several years. I\n",
      "attended him in his last illness. He was buried in London, at the church\n",
      "of Saint Pancras-in-the-Fields. His unpopularity with the blackguard\n",

      "carried in my pocket-book,” with a hurried hand he produced and opened\n",
      "it, “ever since. There it is. Oh, look at it, look at it! You may take\n",
      "it in your hand; it’s no forgery.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, Mr. Lorry perceived the reflection on the wall to elongate, and\n",
      "Mr. Cruncher rose and stepped forward. His hair could not have been more\n",
      "violently on end, if it had been that moment dressed by the Cow with the\n",
      "crumpled horn in the house that Jack built.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unseen by the spy, Mr. Cruncher stood at his side, and touched him on\n",
      "the shoulder like a ghostly bailiff.\n",

      "\n",
      "“At another time, sir,” he returned, evasively, “the present time is\n",

      "in so much as a word of one syllable, and I’ll either catch hold of his\n",

      "card--a certain Guillotine card! Do you play?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No!” returned the spy. “I throw up. I confess that we were so unpopular\n",
      "with the outrageous mob, that I only got away from England at the risk\n",
      "of being ducked to death, and that Cly was so ferreted up and down, that\n",
      "he never would have got away at all but for that sham. Though how this\n",

      "Now, it is of no use asking too much of me. Ask me to do anything in my\n",
      "office, putting my head in great extra danger, and I had better trust my\n",
      "life to the chances of a refusal than the chances of consent. In short,\n",
      "I should make that choice. You talk of desperation. We are all desperate\n",

      "at Jerry in considerable doubt and mistrust. That honest tradesman’s\n",
      "manner of receiving the look, did not inspire confidence; he changed the\n",
      "leg on which he rested, as often as if he had fifty of those limbs,\n",
      "and were trying them all; he examined his finger-nails with a very\n",
      "questionable closeness of attention; and whenever Mr. Lorry’s eye caught\n",
      "his, he was taken with that peculiar kind of short cough requiring the\n",

      "\n",
      "After some cogitation, accompanied with an intent look at his patron,\n",
      "Mr. Cruncher conceived the luminous idea of replying, “Agicultooral\n",
      "character.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My mind misgives me much,” said Mr. Lorry, angrily shaking a forefinger\n",
      "at him, “that you have used the respectable and great house of Tellson’s\n",
      "as a blind, and that you have had an unlawful occupation of an infamous\n",
      "description. If you have, don’t expect me to befriend you when you\n",
      "get back to England. If you have, don’t expect me to keep your secret.\n",
      "Tellson’s shall not be imposed upon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hope, sir,” pleaded the abashed Mr. Cruncher, “that a gentleman like\n",
      "yourself wot I’ve had the honour of odd jobbing till I’m grey at it,\n",
      "would think twice about harming of me, even if it wos so--I don’t say it\n",
      "is, but even if it wos. And which it is to be took into account that if\n",
      "it wos, it wouldn’t, even then, be all o’ one side. There’d be two sides\n",
      "to it. There might be medical doctors at the present hour, a picking\n",
      "up their guineas where a honest tradesman don’t pick up his\n",
      "fardens--fardens! no, nor yet his half fardens--half fardens! no, nor\n",
      "yet his quarter--a banking away like smoke at Tellson’s, and a cocking\n",
      "their medical eyes at that tradesman on the sly, a going in and going\n",
      "out to their own carriages--ah! equally like smoke, if not more so.\n",
      "Well, that ’ud be imposing, too, on Tellson’s. For you cannot sarse the\n",
      "goose and not the gander. And here’s Mrs. Cruncher, or leastways wos\n",
      "in the Old England times, and would be to-morrow, if cause given,\n",
      "a floppin’ again the business to that degree as is ruinating--stark\n",
      "ruinating! Whereas them medical doctors’ wives don’t flop--catch ’em at\n",
      "it! Or, if they flop, their floppings goes in favour of more patients,\n",
      "and how can you rightly have one without t’other? Then, wot with\n",
      "undertakers, and wot with parish clerks, and wot with sextons, and wot\n",
      "with private watchmen (all awaricious and all in it), a man wouldn’t get\n",

      "“Don’t prevaricate,” said Mr. Lorry.\n",

      "further from his thoughts or practice--“which I don’t say it is--wot I\n",
      "would humbly offer to you, sir, would be this. Upon that there stool, at\n",

      "your heels is where your head is, if such should be your wishes. If it\n",
      "wos so, which I still don’t say it is (for I will not prewaricate to\n",
      "you, sir), let that there boy keep his father’s place, and take care of\n",
      "his mother; don’t blow upon that boy’s father--do not do it, sir--and\n",

      "a will, and with conwictions respectin’ the futur’ keepin’ of ’em safe.\n",
      "That, Mr. Lorry,” said Mr. Cruncher, wiping his forehead with his\n",
      "arm, as an announcement that he had arrived at the peroration of his\n",

      "\n",
      "Mr. Cruncher knuckled his forehead, as Sydney Carton and the spy\n",

      "arrangement thus made, you have nothing to fear from me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He sat down in a chair on the hearth, over against Mr. Lorry. When they\n",
      "were alone, Mr. Lorry asked him what he had done?\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not much. If it should go ill with the prisoner, I have ensured access\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",

      "to put this man’s head under the axe, and, as he himself said, nothing\n",
      "worse could happen to him if he were denounced. It was obviously the\n",
      "weakness of the position. There is no help for it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But access to him,” said Mr. Lorry, “if it should go ill before the\n",

      "darling, and the heavy disappointment of his second arrest, gradually\n",
      "weakened them; he was an old man now, overborne with anxiety of late,\n",
      "and his tears fell.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are a good man and a true friend,” said Carton, in an altered\n",
      "voice. “Forgive me if I notice that you are affected. I could not see my\n",
      "father weep, and sit by, careless. And I could not respect your\n",

      "Though he said the last words, with a slip into his usual manner, there\n",
      "was a true feeling and respect both in his tone and in his touch,\n",
      "that Mr. Lorry, who had never seen the better side of him, was wholly\n",
      "unprepared for. He gave him his hand, and Carton gently pressed it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“To return to poor Darnay,” said Carton. “Don’t tell Her of this\n",

      "to him the means of anticipating the sentence.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lorry had not thought of that, and he looked quickly at Carton to\n",
      "see if it were in his mind. It seemed to be; he returned the look, and\n",
      "evidently understood it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She might think a thousand things,” Carton said, “and any of them would\n",
      "only add to her trouble. Don’t speak of me to her. As I said to you when\n",
      "I first came, I had better not see her. I can put my hand out, to do any\n",
      "little helpful work for her that my hand can find to do, without that.\n",

      "fire. A light, or a shade (the old gentleman could not have said which),\n",
      "passed from it as swiftly as a change will sweep over a hill-side on a\n",
      "wild bright day, and he lifted his foot to put back one of the little\n",
      "flaming logs, which was tumbling forward. He wore the white riding-coat\n",
      "and top-boots, then in vogue, and the light of the fire touching their\n",
      "light surfaces made him look very pale, with his long brown hair,\n",
      "all untrimmed, hanging loose about him. His indifference to fire was\n",
      "sufficiently remarkable to elicit a word of remonstrance from Mr. Lorry;\n",
      "his boot was still upon the hot embers of the flaming log, when it had\n",
      "broken under the weight of his foot.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I forgot it,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lorry’s eyes were again attracted to his face. Taking note of the\n",
      "wasted air which clouded the naturally handsome features, and having\n",
      "the expression of prisoners’ faces fresh in his mind, he was strongly\n",
      "reminded of that expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And your duties here have drawn to an end, sir?” said Carton, turning\n",
      "to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. As I was telling you last night when Lucie came in so\n",
      "unexpectedly, I have at length done all that I can do here. I hoped to\n",
      "have left them in perfect safety, and then to have quitted Paris. I have\n",
      "my Leave to Pass. I was ready to go.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They were both silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yours is a long life to look back upon, sir?” said Carton, wistfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am in my seventy-eighth year.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have been useful all your life; steadily and constantly occupied;\n",
      "trusted, respected, and looked up to?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have been a man of business, ever since I have been a man. Indeed, I\n",
      "may say that I was a man of business when a boy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“See what a place you fill at seventy-eight. How many people will miss\n",
      "you when you leave it empty!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A solitary old bachelor,” answered Mr. Lorry, shaking his head. “There\n",
      "is nobody to weep for me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How can you say that? Wouldn’t She weep for you? Wouldn’t her child?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, yes, thank God. I didn’t quite mean what I said.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It _is_ a thing to thank God for; is it not?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Surely, surely.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you could say, with truth, to your own solitary heart, to-night,\n",
      "‘I have secured to myself the love and attachment, the gratitude or\n",
      "respect, of no human creature; I have won myself a tender place in no\n",
      "regard; I have done nothing good or serviceable to be remembered by!’\n",
      "your seventy-eight years would be seventy-eight heavy curses; would they\n",
      "not?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You say truly, Mr. Carton; I think they would be.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sydney turned his eyes again upon the fire, and, after a silence of a\n",
      "few moments, said:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should like to ask you:--Does your childhood seem far off? Do the\n",
      "days when you sat at your mother’s knee, seem days of very long ago?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Responding to his softened manner, Mr. Lorry answered:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Twenty years back, yes; at this time of my life, no. For, as I draw\n",
      "closer and closer to the end, I travel in the circle, nearer and\n",
      "nearer to the beginning. It seems to be one of the kind smoothings and\n",
      "preparings of the way. My heart is touched now, by many remembrances\n",
      "that had long fallen asleep, of my pretty young mother (and I so old!),\n",
      "and by many associations of the days when what we call the World was not\n",
      "so real with me, and my faults were not confirmed in me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I understand the feeling!” exclaimed Carton, with a bright flush. “And\n",
      "you are the better for it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hope so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Carton terminated the conversation here, by rising to help him on with\n",
      "his outer coat; “But you,” said Mr. Lorry, reverting to the theme, “you\n",
      "are young.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said Carton. “I am not old, but my young way was never the way to\n",
      "age. Enough of me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And of me, I am sure,” said Mr. Lorry. “Are you going out?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll walk with you to her gate. You know my vagabond and restless\n",
      "habits. If I should prowl about the streets a long time, don’t be\n",
      "uneasy; I shall reappear in the morning. You go to the Court to-morrow?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, unhappily.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shall be there, but only as one of the crowd. My Spy will find a\n",
      "place for me. Take my arm, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lorry did so, and they went down-stairs and out in the streets. A\n",
      "few minutes brought them to Mr. Lorry’s destination. Carton left him\n",
      "there; but lingered at a little distance, and turned back to the gate\n",
      "again when it was shut, and touched it. He had heard of her going to\n",
      "the prison every day. “She came out here,” he said, looking about him,\n",
      "“turned this way, must have trod on these stones often. Let me follow in\n",
      "her steps.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was ten o’clock at night when he stood before the prison of La Force,\n",
      "where she had stood hundreds of times. A little wood-sawyer, having\n",
      "closed his shop, was smoking his pipe at his shop-door.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good night, citizen,” said Sydney Carton, pausing in going by; for, the\n",
      "man eyed him inquisitively.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good night, citizen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How goes the Republic?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You mean the Guillotine. Not ill. Sixty-three to-day. We shall mount\n",
      "to a hundred soon. Samson and his men complain sometimes, of being\n",
      "exhausted. Ha, ha, ha! He is so droll, that Samson. Such a Barber!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you often go to see him--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shave? Always. Every day. What a barber! You have seen him at work?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Go and see him when he has a good batch. Figure this to yourself,\n",
      "citizen; he shaved the sixty-three to-day, in less than two pipes! Less\n",
      "than two pipes. Word of honour!”\n",
      "\n",
      "As the grinning little man held out the pipe he was smoking, to explain\n",
      "how he timed the executioner, Carton was so sensible of a rising desire\n",
      "to strike the life out of him, that he turned away.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But you are not English,” said the wood-sawyer, “though you wear\n",
      "English dress?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said Carton, pausing again, and answering over his shoulder.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You speak like a Frenchman.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am an old student here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aha, a perfect Frenchman! Good night, Englishman.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good night, citizen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But go and see that droll dog,” the little man persisted, calling after\n",
      "him. “And take a pipe with you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sydney had not gone far out of sight, when he stopped in the middle of\n",
      "the street under a glimmering lamp, and wrote with his pencil on a scrap\n",
      "of paper. Then, traversing with the decided step of one who remembered\n",
      "the way well, several dark and dirty streets--much dirtier than usual,\n",
      "for the best public thoroughfares remained uncleansed in those times of\n",
      "terror--he stopped at a chemist’s shop, which the owner was closing with\n",
      "his own hands. A small, dim, crooked shop, kept in a tortuous, up-hill\n",
      "thoroughfare, by a small, dim, crooked man.\n",
      "\n",
      "Giving this citizen, too, good night, as he confronted him at his\n",
      "counter, he laid the scrap of paper before him. “Whew!” the chemist\n",
      "whistled softly, as he read it. “Hi! hi! hi!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Sydney Carton took no heed, and the chemist said:\n",
      "\n",
      "“For you, citizen?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“For me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You will be careful to keep them separate, citizen? You know the\n",
      "consequences of mixing them?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perfectly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Certain small packets were made and given to him. He put them, one by\n",
      "one, in the breast of his inner coat, counted out the money for them,\n",
      "and deliberately left the shop. “There is nothing more to do,” said he,\n",
      "glancing upward at the moon, “until to-morrow. I can’t sleep.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not a reckless manner, the manner in which he said these words\n",
      "aloud under the fast-sailing clouds, nor was it more expressive of\n",
      "negligence than defiance. It was the settled manner of a tired man, who\n",
      "had wandered and struggled and got lost, but who at length struck into\n",
      "his road and saw its end.\n",
      "\n",
      "Long ago, when he had been famous among his earliest competitors as a\n",
      "youth of great promise, he had followed his father to the grave. His\n",
      "mother had died, years before. These solemn words, which had been\n",
      "read at his father’s grave, arose in his mind as he went down the dark\n",
      "streets, among the heavy shadows, with the moon and the clouds sailing\n",
      "on high above him. “I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord:\n",
      "he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and\n",
      "whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall never die.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In a city dominated by the axe, alone at night, with natural sorrow\n",
      "rising in him for the sixty-three who had been that day put to death,\n",
      "and for to-morrow’s victims then awaiting their doom in the prisons,\n",
      "and still of to-morrow’s and to-morrow’s, the chain of association that\n",
      "brought the words home, like a rusty old ship’s anchor from the deep,\n",
      "might have been easily found. He did not seek it, but repeated them and\n",
      "went on.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a solemn interest in the lighted windows where the people were\n",
      "going to rest, forgetful through a few calm hours of the horrors\n",
      "surrounding them; in the towers of the churches, where no prayers\n",
      "were said, for the popular revulsion had even travelled that length\n",
      "of self-destruction from years of priestly impostors, plunderers, and\n",
      "profligates; in the distant burial-places, reserved, as they wrote upon\n",
      "the gates, for Eternal Sleep; in the abounding gaols; and in the streets\n",
      "along which the sixties rolled to a death which had become so common and\n",
      "material, that no sorrowful story of a haunting Spirit ever arose among\n",
      "the people out of all the working of the Guillotine; with a solemn\n",
      "interest in the whole life and death of the city settling down to its\n",
      "short nightly pause in fury; Sydney Carton crossed the Seine again for\n",
      "the lighter streets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Few coaches were abroad, for riders in coaches were liable to be\n",
      "suspected, and gentility hid its head in red nightcaps, and put on heavy\n",
      "shoes, and trudged. But, the theatres were all well filled, and the\n",
      "people poured cheerfully out as he passed, and went chatting home. At\n",
      "one of the theatre doors, there was a little girl with a mother, looking\n",
      "for a way across the street through the mud. He carried the child over,\n",
      "and before the timid arm was loosed from his neck asked her for a kiss.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord: he that believeth\n",
      "in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and\n",
      "believeth in me, shall never die.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, that the streets were quiet, and the night wore on, the words\n",
      "were in the echoes of his feet, and were in the air. Perfectly calm\n",
      "and steady, he sometimes repeated them to himself as he walked; but, he\n",
      "heard them always.\n",
      "\n",
      "The night wore out, and, as he stood upon the bridge listening to the\n",
      "water as it splashed the river-walls of the Island of Paris, where the\n",
      "picturesque confusion of houses and cathedral shone bright in the light\n",
      "of the moon, the day came coldly, looking like a dead face out of the\n",
      "sky. Then, the night, with the moon and the stars, turned pale and died,\n",
      "and for a little while it seemed as if Creation were delivered over to\n",
      "Death’s dominion.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, the glorious sun, rising, seemed to strike those words, that burden\n",
      "of the night, straight and warm to his heart in its long bright rays.\n",
      "And looking along them, with reverently shaded eyes, a bridge of light\n",
      "appeared to span the air between him and the sun, while the river\n",
      "sparkled under it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The strong tide, so swift, so deep, and certain, was like a congenial\n",
      "friend, in the morning stillness. He walked by the stream, far from the\n",
      "houses, and in the light and warmth of the sun fell asleep on the\n",
      "bank. When he awoke and was afoot again, he lingered there yet a little\n",
      "longer, watching an eddy that turned and turned purposeless, until the\n",
      "stream absorbed it, and carried it on to the sea.--“Like me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A trading-boat, with a sail of the softened colour of a dead leaf, then\n",
      "glided into his view, floated by him, and died away. As its silent track\n",
      "in the water disappeared, the prayer that had broken up out of his heart\n",
      "for a merciful consideration of all his poor blindnesses and errors,\n",
      "ended in the words, “I am the resurrection and the life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lorry was already out when he got back, and it was easy to surmise\n",
      "where the good old man was gone. Sydney Carton drank nothing but a\n",
      "little coffee, ate some bread, and, having washed and changed to refresh\n",
      "himself, went out to the place of trial.\n",
      "\n",
      "The court was all astir and a-buzz, when the black sheep--whom many fell\n",
      "away from in dread--pressed him into an obscure corner among the crowd.\n",
      "Mr. Lorry was there, and Doctor Manette was there. She was there,\n",
      "sitting beside her father.\n",
      "\n",
      "When her husband was brought in, she turned a look upon him, so\n",
      "sustaining, so encouraging, so full of admiring love and pitying\n",
      "tenderness, yet so courageous for his sake, that it called the healthy\n",
      "blood into his face, brightened his glance, and animated his heart. If\n",
      "there had been any eyes to notice the influence of her look, on Sydney\n",
      "Carton, it would have been seen to be the same influence exactly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before that unjust Tribunal, there was little or no order of procedure,\n",
      "ensuring to any accused person any reasonable hearing. There could have\n",
      "been no such Revolution, if all laws, forms, and ceremonies, had not\n",
      "first been so monstrously abused, that the suicidal vengeance of the\n",
      "Revolution was to scatter them all to the winds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every eye was turned to the jury. The same determined patriots and good\n",
      "republicans as yesterday and the day before, and to-morrow and the day\n",
      "after. Eager and prominent among them, one man with a craving face, and\n",
      "his fingers perpetually hovering about his lips, whose appearance\n",
      "gave great satisfaction to the spectators. A life-thirsting,\n",
      "cannibal-looking, bloody-minded juryman, the Jacques Three of St.\n",
      "Antoine. The whole jury, as a jury of dogs empannelled to try the deer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every eye then turned to the five judges and the public prosecutor.\n",
      "No favourable leaning in that quarter to-day. A fell, uncompromising,\n",
      "murderous business-meaning there. Every eye then sought some other eye\n",
      "in the crowd, and gleamed at it approvingly; and heads nodded at one\n",
      "another, before bending forward with a strained attention.\n",

      "cell in the Bastille, during the last month of the year, 1767. I write\n",
      "it at stolen intervals, under every difficulty. I design to secrete it\n",
      "in the wall of the chimney, where I have slowly and laboriously made a\n",

      "at an hour’s distance from my place of residence in the Street of the\n",
      "School of Medicine, when a carriage came along behind me, driven very\n",

      "voice called to the driver to stop.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The carriage stopped as soon as the driver could rein in his horses,\n",

      "her sides with sashes and handkerchiefs. I noticed that these bonds were\n",
      "all portions of a gentleman’s dress. On one of them, which was a fringed\n",

      "in danger of suffocation. My first act was to put out my hand to relieve\n",
      "her breathing; and in moving the scarf aside, the embroidery in the\n",
      "corner caught my sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I turned her gently over, placed my hands upon her breast to calm her\n",

      "wild, and she constantly uttered piercing shrieks, and repeated the\n",
      "words, ‘My husband, my father, and my brother!’ and then counted up to\n",
      "twelve, and said, ‘Hush!’ For an instant, and no more, she would pause\n",
      "to listen, and then the piercing shrieks would begin again, and she\n",
      "would repeat the cry, ‘My husband, my father, and my brother!’ and\n",
      "would count up to twelve, and say, ‘Hush!’ There was no variation in the\n",
      "order, or the manner. There was no cessation, but the regular moment’s\n",

      "after a while, and as it was necessary to watch its influence, I then\n",
      "sat down by the side of the bed. There was a timid and suppressed woman\n",
      "in attendance (wife of the man down-stairs), who had retreated into\n",
      "a corner. The house was damp and decayed, indifferently\n",
      "furnished--evidently, recently occupied and temporarily used. Some thick\n",
      "old hangings had been nailed up before the windows, to deaden the\n",
      "sound of the shrieks. They continued to be uttered in their regular\n",
      "succession, with the cry, ‘My husband, my father, and my brother!’ the\n",
      "counting up to twelve, and ‘Hush!’ The frenzy was so violent, that I had\n",
      "not unfastened the bandages restraining the arms; but, I had looked to\n",
      "them, to see that they were not painful. The only spark of encouragement\n",
      "in the case, was, that my hand upon the sufferer’s breast had this much\n",
      "soothing influence, that for minutes at a time it tranquillised the\n",
      "figure. It had no effect upon the cries; no pendulum could be more\n",
      "regular.\n",

      "there were beams across. Hay and straw were stored in that portion of\n",
      "the place, fagots for firing, and a heap of apples in sand. I had to\n",

      "do well, in the mean time, to show myself? I think so. It is best that\n",
      "these people should know there is such a man as I here; it is a sound\n",

      "Checking his steps which had begun to tend towards an object, he took a\n",
      "turn or two in the already darkening street, and traced the thought\n",
      "in his mind to its possible consequences. His first impression was\n",
      "confirmed. “It is best,” he said, finally resolved, “that these people\n",
      "should know there is such a man as I here.” And he turned his face\n",
      "towards Saint Antoine.\n",

      "the Saint Antoine suburb. It was not difficult for one who knew the city\n",
      "well, to find his house without asking any question. Having ascertained\n",
      "its situation, Carton came out of those closer streets again, and dined\n",
      "at a place of refreshment and fell sound asleep after dinner. For the\n",
      "first time in many years, he had no strong drink. Since last night he\n",
      "had taken nothing but a little light thin wine, and last night he had\n",
      "dropped the brandy slowly down on Mr. Lorry’s hearth like a man who had\n",
      "done with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was as late as seven o’clock when he awoke refreshed, and went out\n",
      "into the streets again. As he passed along towards Saint Antoine, he\n",
      "stopped at a shop-window where there was a mirror, and slightly altered\n",
      "the disordered arrangement of his loose cravat, and his coat-collar, and\n",
      "his wild hair. This done, he went on direct to Defarge’s, and went in.\n",
      "\n",
      "There happened to be no customer in the shop but Jacques Three, of the\n",
      "restless fingers and the croaking voice. This man, whom he had seen upon\n",
      "the Jury, stood drinking at the little counter, in conversation with the\n",
      "Defarges, man and wife. The Vengeance assisted in the conversation, like\n",
      "a regular member of the establishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Carton walked in, took his seat and asked (in very indifferent\n",
      "French) for a small measure of wine, Madame Defarge cast a careless\n",
      "glance at him, and then a keener, and then a keener, and then advanced\n",
      "to him herself, and asked him what it was he had ordered.\n",
      "\n",
      "He repeated what he had already said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“English?” asked Madame Defarge, inquisitively raising her dark\n",

      "\n",
      "After looking at her, as if the sound of even a single French word were\n",
      "slow to express itself to him, he answered, in his former strong foreign\n",
      "accent. “Yes, madame, yes. I am English!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Defarge returned to her counter to get the wine, and, as he\n",
      "took up a Jacobin journal and feigned to pore over it puzzling out its\n",
      "meaning, he heard her say, “I swear to you, like Evrémonde!”\n",
      "\n",

      "“How?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good evening.”\n",
      "\n",

      "drink to the Republic.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Defarge went back to the counter, and said, “Certainly, a little like.”\n",
      " Madame sternly retorted, “I tell you a good deal like.” Jacques Three\n",

      "Carton followed the lines and words of his paper, with a slow\n",
      "forefinger, and with a studious and absorbed face. They were all leaning\n",
      "their arms on the counter close together, speaking low. After a silence\n",
      "of a few moments, during which they all looked towards him without\n",
      "disturbing his outward attention from the Jacobin editor, they resumed\n",
      "their conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is true what madame says,” observed Jacques Three. “Why stop? There\n",
      "is great force in that. Why stop?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, well,” reasoned Defarge, “but one must stop somewhere. After all,\n",
      "the question is still where?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“At extermination,” said madame.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Magnificent!” croaked Jacques Three. The Vengeance, also, highly\n",
      "approved.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Extermination is good doctrine, my wife,” said Defarge, rather\n",
      "troubled; “in general, I say nothing against it. But this Doctor has\n",
      "suffered much; you have seen him to-day; you have observed his face when\n",
      "the paper was read.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have observed his face!” repeated madame, contemptuously and angrily.\n",
      "“Yes. I have observed his face. I have observed his face to be not the\n",
      "face of a true friend of the Republic. Let him take care of his face!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And you have observed, my wife,” said Defarge, in a deprecatory manner,\n",
      "“the anguish of his daughter, which must be a dreadful anguish to him!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have observed his daughter,” repeated madame; “yes, I have observed\n",
      "his daughter, more times than one. I have observed her to-day, and I\n",
      "have observed her other days. I have observed her in the court, and\n",
      "I have observed her in the street by the prison. Let me but lift my\n",
      "finger--!” She seemed to raise it (the listener’s eyes were always on\n",
      "his paper), and to let it fall with a rattle on the ledge before her, as\n",
      "if the axe had dropped.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The citizeness is superb!” croaked the Juryman.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She is an Angel!” said The Vengeance, and embraced her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As to thee,” pursued madame, implacably, addressing her husband, “if it\n",
      "depended on thee--which, happily, it does not--thou wouldst rescue this\n",
      "man even now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No!” protested Defarge. “Not if to lift this glass would do it! But I\n",
      "would leave the matter there. I say, stop there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“See you then, Jacques,” said Madame Defarge, wrathfully; “and see you,\n",
      "too, my little Vengeance; see you both! Listen! For other crimes as\n",
      "tyrants and oppressors, I have this race a long time on my register,\n",
      "doomed to destruction and extermination. Ask my husband, is that so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is so,” assented Defarge, without being asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In the beginning of the great days, when the Bastille falls, he finds\n",
      "this paper of to-day, and he brings it home, and in the middle of the\n",
      "night when this place is clear and shut, we read it, here on this spot,\n",
      "by the light of this lamp. Ask him, is that so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is so,” assented Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That night, I tell him, when the paper is read through, and the lamp is\n",
      "burnt out, and the day is gleaming in above those shutters and between\n",
      "those iron bars, that I have now a secret to communicate. Ask him, is\n",
      "that so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is so,” assented Defarge again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I communicate to him that secret. I smite this bosom with these two\n",
      "hands as I smite it now, and I tell him, ‘Defarge, I was brought up\n",
      "among the fishermen of the sea-shore, and that peasant family so injured\n",
      "by the two Evrémonde brothers, as that Bastille paper describes, is my\n",
      "family. Defarge, that sister of the mortally wounded boy upon the ground\n",
      "was my sister, that husband was my sister’s husband, that unborn child\n",
      "was their child, that brother was my brother, that father was my father,\n",
      "those dead are my dead, and that summons to answer for those things\n",
      "descends to me!’ Ask him, is that so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is so,” assented Defarge once more.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then tell Wind and Fire where to stop,” returned madame; “but don’t\n",
      "tell me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Both her hearers derived a horrible enjoyment from the deadly nature\n",
      "of her wrath--the listener could feel how white she was, without seeing\n",
      "her--and both highly commended it. Defarge, a weak minority, interposed\n",
      "a few words for the memory of the compassionate wife of the Marquis; but\n",
      "only elicited from his own wife a repetition of her last reply. “Tell\n",
      "the Wind and the Fire where to stop; not me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Customers entered, and the group was broken up. The English customer\n",
      "paid for what he had had, perplexedly counted his change, and asked, as\n",
      "a stranger, to be directed towards the National Palace. Madame Defarge\n",
      "took him to the door, and put her arm on his, in pointing out the road.\n",
      "The English customer was not without his reflections then, that it might\n",
      "be a good deed to seize that arm, lift it, and strike under it sharp and\n",
      "deep.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, he went his way, and was soon swallowed up in the shadow of the\n",
      "prison wall. At the appointed hour, he emerged from it to present\n",
      "himself in Mr. Lorry’s room again, where he found the old gentleman\n",
      "walking to and fro in restless anxiety. He said he had been with Lucie\n",
      "until just now, and had only left her for a few minutes, to come and\n",
      "keep his appointment. Her father had not been seen, since he quitted the\n",
      "banking-house towards four o’clock. She had some faint hopes that his\n",
      "mediation might save Charles, but they were very slight. He had been\n",
      "more than five hours gone: where could he be?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lorry waited until ten; but, Doctor Manette not returning, and\n",
      "he being unwilling to leave Lucie any longer, it was arranged that he\n",
      "should go back to her, and come to the banking-house again at midnight.\n",
      "In the meanwhile, Carton would wait alone by the fire for the Doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      "He waited and waited, and the clock struck twelve; but Doctor Manette\n",
      "did not come back. Mr. Lorry returned, and found no tidings of him, and\n",
      "brought none. Where could he be?\n",
      "\n",
      "They were discussing this question, and were almost building up some\n",
      "weak structure of hope on his prolonged absence, when they heard him on\n",
      "the stairs. The instant he entered the room, it was plain that all was\n",
      "lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether he had really been to any one, or whether he had been all that\n",
      "time traversing the streets, was never known. As he stood staring at\n",
      "them, they asked him no question, for his face told them everything.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I cannot find it,” said he, “and I must have it. Where is it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "His head and throat were bare, and, as he spoke with a helpless look\n",
      "straying all around, he took his coat off, and let it drop on the floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where is my bench? I have been looking everywhere for my bench, and I\n",
      "can’t find it. What have they done with my work? Time presses: I must\n",
      "finish those shoes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They looked at one another, and their hearts died within them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come, come!” said he, in a whimpering miserable way; “let me get to\n",
      "work. Give me my work.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Receiving no answer, he tore his hair, and beat his feet upon the\n",
      "ground, like a distracted child.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t torture a poor forlorn wretch,” he implored them, with a dreadful\n",
      "cry; “but give me my work! What is to become of us, if those shoes are\n",
      "not done to-night?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lost, utterly lost!\n",
      "\n",
      "It was so clearly beyond hope to reason with him, or try to restore him,\n",
      "that--as if by agreement--they each put a hand upon his shoulder, and\n",
      "soothed him to sit down before the fire, with a promise that he should\n",
      "have his work presently. He sank into the chair, and brooded over the\n",
      "embers, and shed tears. As if all that had happened since the garret\n",
      "time were a momentary fancy, or a dream, Mr. Lorry saw him shrink into\n",
      "the exact figure that Defarge had had in keeping.\n",
      "\n",
      "Affected, and impressed with terror as they both were, by this spectacle\n",
      "of ruin, it was not a time to yield to such emotions. His lonely\n",
      "daughter, bereft of her final hope and reliance, appealed to them both\n",
      "too strongly. Again, as if by agreement, they looked at one another with\n",
      "one meaning in their faces. Carton was the first to speak:\n",
      "\n",
      "“The last chance is gone: it was not much. Yes; he had better be taken\n",
      "to her. But, before you go, will you, for a moment, steadily attend to\n",
      "me? Don’t ask me why I make the stipulations I am going to make, and\n",
      "exact the promise I am going to exact; I have a reason--a good one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not doubt it,” answered Mr. Lorry. “Say on.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The figure in the chair between them, was all the time monotonously\n",
      "rocking itself to and fro, and moaning. They spoke in such a tone as\n",
      "they would have used if they had been watching by a sick-bed in the\n",
      "night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Carton stooped to pick up the coat, which lay almost entangling his\n",
      "feet. As he did so, a small case in which the Doctor was accustomed to\n",
      "carry the lists of his day’s duties, fell lightly on the floor. Carton\n",
      "took it up, and there was a folded paper in it. “We should look\n",
      "at this!” he said. Mr. Lorry nodded his consent. He opened it, and\n",
      "exclaimed, “Thank _God!_”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is it?” asked Mr. Lorry, eagerly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A moment! Let me speak of it in its place. First,” he put his hand in\n",
      "his coat, and took another paper from it, “that is the certificate which\n",
      "enables me to pass out of this city. Look at it. You see--Sydney Carton,\n",
      "an Englishman?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Lorry held it open in his hand, gazing in his earnest face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Keep it for me until to-morrow. I shall see him to-morrow, you\n",
      "remember, and I had better not take it into the prison.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why not?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t know; I prefer not to do so. Now, take this paper that Doctor\n",
      "Manette has carried about him. It is a similar certificate, enabling him\n",
      "and his daughter and her child, at any time, to pass the barrier and the\n",
      "frontier! You see?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perhaps he obtained it as his last and utmost precaution against evil,\n",
      "yesterday. When is it dated? But no matter; don’t stay to look; put it\n",
      "up carefully with mine and your own. Now, observe! I never doubted until\n",
      "within this hour or two, that he had, or could have such a paper. It is\n",

      "woman’s, to-night, which have presented their danger to me in strong\n",
      "colours. I have lost no time, and since then, I have seen the spy. He\n",
      "confirms me. He knows that a wood-sawyer, living by the prison wall,\n",
      "is under the control of the Defarges, and has been rehearsed by\n",
      "Madame Defarge as to his having seen Her”--he never mentioned Lucie’s\n",

      "mourn for, or sympathise with, a victim of the Guillotine. She and her\n",
      "father would unquestionably be guilty of this crime, and this woman (the\n",

      "to roll that afternoon on the life-tide of the city to the boundless\n",
      "everlasting sea. Before their cells were quit of them, new occupants\n",
      "were appointed; before their blood ran into the blood spilled yesterday,\n",
      "the blood that was to mingle with theirs to-morrow was already set\n",
      "apart.\n",

      "Two score and twelve were told off. From the farmer-general of seventy,\n",

      "in the vices and neglects of men, will seize on victims of all degrees;\n",
      "and the frightful moral disorder, born of unspeakable suffering,\n",
      "intolerable oppression, and heartless indifference, smote equally\n",
      "without distinction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Charles Darnay, alone in a cell, had sustained himself with no\n",
      "flattering delusion since he came to it from the Tribunal. In every line\n",
      "of the narrative he had heard, he had heard his condemnation. He had\n",
      "fully comprehended that no personal influence could possibly save him,\n",
      "that he was virtually sentenced by the millions, and that units could\n",
      "avail him nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, it was not easy, with the face of his beloved wife fresh\n",
      "before him, to compose his mind to what it must bear. His hold on life\n",
      "was strong, and it was very, very hard, to loosen; by gradual efforts\n",
      "and degrees unclosed a little here, it clenched the tighter there; and\n",
      "when he brought his strength to bear on that hand and it yielded,\n",
      "this was closed again. There was a hurry, too, in all his thoughts,\n",
      "a turbulent and heated working of his heart, that contended against\n",
      "resignation. If, for a moment, he did feel resigned, then his wife and\n",
      "child who had to live after him, seemed to protest and to make it a\n",
      "selfish thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, all this was at first. Before long, the consideration that there\n",
      "was no disgrace in the fate he must meet, and that numbers went the same\n",
      "road wrongfully, and trod it firmly every day, sprang up to stimulate\n",
      "him. Next followed the thought that much of the future peace of mind\n",
      "enjoyable by the dear ones, depended on his quiet fortitude. So,\n",
      "by degrees he calmed into the better state, when he could raise his\n",
      "thoughts much higher, and draw comfort down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before it had set in dark on the night of his condemnation, he had\n",
      "travelled thus far on his last way. Being allowed to purchase the means\n",
      "of writing, and a light, he sat down to write until such time as the\n",
      "prison lamps should be extinguished.\n",
      "\n",
      "He wrote a long letter to Lucie, showing her that he had known nothing\n",
      "of her father’s imprisonment, until he had heard of it from herself,\n",
      "and that he had been as ignorant as she of his father’s and uncle’s\n",
      "responsibility for that misery, until the paper had been read. He had\n",
      "already explained to her that his concealment from herself of the name\n",
      "he had relinquished, was the one condition--fully intelligible now--that\n",
      "her father had attached to their betrothal, and was the one promise he\n",
      "had still exacted on the morning of their marriage. He entreated her,\n",
      "for her father’s sake, never to seek to know whether her father had\n",
      "become oblivious of the existence of the paper, or had had it recalled\n",
      "to him (for the moment, or for good), by the story of the Tower, on\n",
      "that old Sunday under the dear old plane-tree in the garden. If he had\n",
      "preserved any definite remembrance of it, there could be no doubt that\n",
      "he had supposed it destroyed with the Bastille, when he had found no\n",
      "mention of it among the relics of prisoners which the populace had\n",
      "discovered there, and which had been described to all the world. He\n",
      "besought her--though he added that he knew it was needless--to console\n",
      "her father, by impressing him through every tender means she could think\n",
      "of, with the truth that he had done nothing for which he could justly\n",
      "reproach himself, but had uniformly forgotten himself for their joint\n",
      "sakes. Next to her preservation of his own last grateful love and\n",
      "blessing, and her overcoming of her sorrow, to devote herself to their\n",
      "dear child, he adjured her, as they would meet in Heaven, to comfort her\n",
      "father.\n",
      "\n",
      "To her father himself, he wrote in the same strain; but, he told her\n",
      "father that he expressly confided his wife and child to his care. And\n",
      "he told him this, very strongly, with the hope of rousing him from any\n",
      "despondency or dangerous retrospect towards which he foresaw he might be\n",
      "tending.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Mr. Lorry, he commended them all, and explained his worldly affairs.\n",
      "That done, with many added sentences of grateful friendship and warm\n",
      "attachment, all was done. He never thought of Carton. His mind was so\n",
      "full of the others, that he never once thought of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had time to finish these letters before the lights were put out. When\n",
      "he lay down on his straw bed, he thought he had done with this world.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, it beckoned him back in his sleep, and showed itself in shining\n",
      "forms. Free and happy, back in the old house in Soho (though it had\n",
      "nothing in it like the real house), unaccountably released and light of\n",
      "heart, he was with Lucie again, and she told him it was all a dream, and\n",
      "he had never gone away. A pause of forgetfulness, and then he had even\n",
      "suffered, and had come back to her, dead and at peace, and yet there\n",
      "was no difference in him. Another pause of oblivion, and he awoke in the\n",
      "sombre morning, unconscious where he was or what had happened, until it\n",
      "flashed upon his mind, “this is the day of my death!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, had he come through the hours, to the day when the fifty-two heads\n",
      "were to fall. And now, while he was composed, and hoped that he could\n",
      "meet the end with quiet heroism, a new action began in his waking\n",
      "thoughts, which was very difficult to master.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had never seen the instrument that was to terminate his life. How\n",
      "high it was from the ground, how many steps it had, where he would be\n",
      "stood, how he would be touched, whether the touching hands would be dyed\n",
      "red, which way his face would be turned, whether he would be the first,\n",
      "or might be the last: these and many similar questions, in nowise\n",
      "directed by his will, obtruded themselves over and over again, countless\n",
      "times. Neither were they connected with fear: he was conscious of no\n",
      "fear. Rather, they originated in a strange besetting desire to know what\n",
      "to do when the time came; a desire gigantically disproportionate to the\n",
      "few swift moments to which it referred; a wondering that was more like\n",
      "the wondering of some other spirit within his, than his own.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hours went on as he walked to and fro, and the clocks struck the\n",
      "numbers he would never hear again. Nine gone for ever, ten gone for\n",
      "ever, eleven gone for ever, twelve coming on to pass away. After a hard\n",
      "contest with that eccentric action of thought which had last perplexed\n",
      "him, he had got the better of it. He walked up and down, softly\n",
      "repeating their names to himself. The worst of the strife was over.\n",
      "He could walk up and down, free from distracting fancies, praying for\n",
      "himself and for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Twelve gone for ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had been apprised that the final hour was Three, and he knew he would\n",
      "be summoned some time earlier, inasmuch as the tumbrils jolted heavily\n",
      "and slowly through the streets. Therefore, he resolved to keep Two\n",
      "before his mind, as the hour, and so to strengthen himself in the\n",
      "interval that he might be able, after that time, to strengthen others.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The key was put in the lock, and turned. Before the door was opened, or\n",
      "as it opened, a man said in a low voice, in English: “He has never seen\n",

      "no time!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The door was quickly opened and closed, and there stood before him\n",

      "features, and a cautionary finger on his lip, Sydney Carton.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was something so bright and remarkable in his look, that, for the\n",
      "first moment, the prisoner misdoubted him to be an apparition of his own\n",
      "imagining. But, he spoke, and it was his voice; he took the prisoner’s\n",
      "hand, and it was his real grasp.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of all the people upon earth, you least expected to see me?” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I could not believe it to be you. I can scarcely believe it now. You\n",

      "words with his eyes fixed on the writer, his hand slowly and softly\n",
      "moved down close to the writer’s face.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pen dropped from Darnay’s fingers on the table, and he looked about\n",

      "with a reproachful look, but Carton’s hand was close and firm at his\n",

      "seconds he faintly struggled with the man who had come to lay down his\n",
      "life for him; but, within a minute or so, he was stretched insensible on\n",

      "\n",
      "Quickly, but with hands as true to the purpose as his heart was, Carton\n",

      "“Him, man, with whom I have exchanged. You go out at the gate by which\n",
      "you brought me in?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was weak and faint when you brought me in, and I am fainter now you\n",
      "take me out. The parting interview has overpowered me. Such a thing has\n",
      "happened here, often, and too often. Your life is in your own hands.\n",
      "Quick! Call assistance!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You swear not to betray me?” said the trembling Spy, as he paused for a\n",
      "last moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Man, man!” returned Carton, stamping his foot; “have I sworn by no\n",
      "solemn vow already, to go through with this, that you waste the precious\n",
      "moments now? Take him yourself to the courtyard you know of, place\n",
      "him yourself in the carriage, show him yourself to Mr. Lorry, tell him\n",
      "yourself to give him no restorative but air, and to remember my words of\n",
      "last night, and his promise of last night, and drive away!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spy withdrew, and Carton seated himself at the table, resting his\n",
      "forehead on his hands. The Spy returned immediately, with two men.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How, then?” said one of them, contemplating the fallen figure. “So\n",
      "afflicted to find that his friend has drawn a prize in the lottery of\n",
      "Sainte Guillotine?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A good patriot,” said the other, “could hardly have been more afflicted\n",
      "if the Aristocrat had drawn a blank.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They raised the unconscious figure, placed it on a litter they had\n",
      "brought to the door, and bent to carry it away.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The time is short, Evrémonde,” said the Spy, in a warning voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know it well,” answered Carton. “Be careful of my friend, I entreat\n",
      "you, and leave me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come, then, my children,” said Barsad. “Lift him, and come away!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The door closed, and Carton was left alone. Straining his powers of\n",
      "listening to the utmost, he listened for any sound that might denote\n",
      "suspicion or alarm. There was none. Keys turned, doors clashed,\n",
      "footsteps passed along distant passages: no cry was raised, or hurry\n",
      "made, that seemed unusual. Breathing more freely in a little while, he\n",
      "sat down at the table, and listened again until the clock struck Two.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sounds that he was not afraid of, for he divined their meaning, then\n",
      "began to be audible. Several doors were opened in succession, and\n",
      "finally his own. A gaoler, with a list in his hand, looked in, merely\n",
      "saying, “Follow me, Evrémonde!” and he followed into a large dark room,\n",
      "at a distance. It was a dark winter day, and what with the shadows\n",
      "within, and what with the shadows without, he could but dimly discern\n",
      "the others who were brought there to have their arms bound. Some were\n",
      "standing; some seated. Some were lamenting, and in restless motion;\n",
      "but, these were few. The great majority were silent and still, looking\n",
      "fixedly at the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he stood by the wall in a dim corner, while some of the fifty-two\n",
      "were brought in after him, one man stopped in passing, to embrace him,\n",
      "as having a knowledge of him. It thrilled him with a great dread of\n",
      "discovery; but the man went on. A very few moments after that, a young\n",
      "woman, with a slight girlish form, a sweet spare face in which there was\n",
      "no vestige of colour, and large widely opened patient eyes, rose from\n",
      "the seat where he had observed her sitting, and came to speak to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Citizen Evrémonde,” she said, touching him with her cold hand. “I am a\n",
      "poor little seamstress, who was with you in La Force.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He murmured for answer: “True. I forget what you were accused of?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Plots. Though the just Heaven knows that I am innocent of any. Is it\n",
      "likely? Who would think of plotting with a poor little weak creature\n",
      "like me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The forlorn smile with which she said it, so touched him, that tears\n",
      "started from his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am not afraid to die, Citizen Evrémonde, but I have done nothing. I\n",

      "\n",
      "As the patient eyes were lifted to his face, he saw a sudden doubt in\n",
      "them, and then astonishment. He pressed the work-worn, hunger-worn young\n",

      "Defarge confer with these ministers, but in the shed of the wood-sawyer,\n",
      "erst a mender of roads. The sawyer himself did not participate in the\n",
      "conference, but abided at a little distance, like an outer satellite who\n",
      "was not to speak until required, or to offer an opinion until invited.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But our Defarge,” said Jacques Three, “is undoubtedly a good\n",

      "\n",
      "“There is no better,” the voluble Vengeance protested in her shrill\n",

      "a slight frown on her lieutenant’s lips, “hear me speak. My husband,\n",
      "fellow-citizen, is a good Republican and a bold man; he has deserved\n",
      "well of the Republic, and possesses its confidence. But my husband has\n",
      "his weaknesses, and he is so weak as to relent towards this Doctor.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is a great pity,” croaked Jacques Three, dubiously shaking his head,\n",
      "with his cruel fingers at his hungry mouth; “it is not quite like a good\n",
      "citizen; it is a thing to regret.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“See you,” said madame, “I care nothing for this Doctor, I. He may wear\n",

      "me. But, the Evrémonde people are to be exterminated, and the wife and\n",
      "child must follow the husband and father.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She has a fine head for it,” croaked Jacques Three. “I have seen blue\n",
      "eyes and golden hair there, and they looked charming when Samson held\n",
      "them up.” Ogre that he was, he spoke like an epicure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Defarge cast down her eyes, and reflected a little.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The child also,” observed Jacques Three, with a meditative enjoyment\n",
      "of his words, “has golden hair and blue eyes. And we seldom have a child\n",
      "there. It is a pretty sight!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In a word,” said Madame Defarge, coming out of her short abstraction,\n",
      "“I cannot trust my husband in this matter. Not only do I feel, since\n",
      "last night, that I dare not confide to him the details of my projects;\n",

      "\n",

      "have not half enough as it is. We ought to have six score a day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In a word,” Madame Defarge went on, “my husband has not my reason for\n",
      "pursuing this family to annihilation, and I have not his reason for\n",
      "regarding this Doctor with any sensibility. I must act for myself,\n",
      "therefore. Come hither, little citizen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The wood-sawyer, who held her in the respect, and himself in the\n",

      "without. I know what I know. I have seen with my eyes.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“Clearly plots,” said Jacques Three. “Transparently!”\n",
      "\n",

      "fellow-Jurymen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, let me see,” said Madame Defarge, pondering again. “Yet once more!\n",
      "Can I spare this Doctor to my husband? I have no feeling either way. Can\n",
      "I spare him?”\n",
      "\n",

      "“We really have not heads enough; it would be a pity, I think.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He was signalling with her when I saw her,” argued Madame Defarge; “I\n",

      "bad witness.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Vengeance and Jacques Three vied with each other in their fervent\n",
      "protestations that she was the most admirable and marvellous of\n",

      "celestial witness.\n",

      "to-day executed.--You?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The question was addressed to the wood-sawyer, who hurriedly replied in\n",
      "the affirmative: seizing the occasion to add that he was the most ardent\n",
      "of Republicans, and that he would be in effect the most desolate of\n",
      "Republicans, if anything prevented him from enjoying the pleasure of\n",
      "smoking his afternoon pipe in the contemplation of the droll national\n",
      "barber. He was so very demonstrative herein, that he might have been\n",
      "suspected (perhaps was, by the dark eyes that looked contemptuously at\n",
      "him out of Madame Defarge’s head) of having his small individual fears\n",
      "for his own personal safety, every hour in the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I,” said madame, “am equally engaged at the same place. After it is\n",
      "over--say at eight to-night--come you to me, in Saint Antoine, and we\n",
      "will give information against these people at my Section.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The wood-sawyer said he would be proud and flattered to attend the\n",
      "citizeness. The citizeness looking at him, he became embarrassed, evaded\n",
      "her glance as a small dog would have done, retreated among his wood, and\n",
      "hid his confusion over the handle of his saw.\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Defarge beckoned the Juryman and The Vengeance a little nearer to\n",
      "the door, and there expounded her further views to them thus:\n",
      "\n",
      "“She will now be at home, awaiting the moment of his death. She will\n",

      "justice of the Republic. She will be full of sympathy with its enemies.\n",
      "I will go to her.”\n",
      "\n",

      "Three, rapturously. “Ah, my cherished!” cried The Vengeance; and\n",
      "embraced her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Take you my knitting,” said Madame Defarge, placing it in her\n",
      "lieutenant’s hands, “and have it ready for me in my usual seat. Keep\n",
      "me my usual chair. Go you there, straight, for there will probably be a\n",
      "greater concourse than usual, to-day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I willingly obey the orders of my Chief,” said The Vengeance with\n",
      "alacrity, and kissing her cheek. “You will not be late?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shall be there before the commencement.”\n",

      "might be relied upon to arrive in good time, and so went through the\n",
      "mud, and round the corner of the prison wall. The Vengeance and the\n",
      "Juryman, looking after her as she walked away, were highly appreciative\n",
      "of her fine figure, and her superb moral endowments.\n",

      "There were many women at that time, upon whom the time laid a dreadfully\n",
      "disfiguring hand; but, there was not one among them more to be dreaded\n",
      "than this ruthless woman, now taking her way along the streets. Of a\n",
      "strong and fearless character, of shrewd sense and readiness, of great\n",
      "determination, of that kind of beauty which not only seems to impart\n",
      "to its possessor firmness and animosity, but to strike into others an\n",
      "instinctive recognition of those qualities; the troubled time would have\n",
      "heaved her up, under any circumstances. But, imbued from her childhood\n",
      "with a brooding sense of wrong, and an inveterate hatred of a class,\n",
      "opportunity had developed her into a tigress. She was absolutely without\n",
      "pity. If she had ever had the virtue in her, it had quite gone out of\n",
      "her.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was nothing to her, that an innocent man was to die for the sins of\n",
      "his forefathers; she saw, not him, but them. It was nothing to her, that\n",
      "his wife was to be made a widow and his daughter an orphan; that was\n",
      "insufficient punishment, because they were her natural enemies and\n",
      "her prey, and as such had no right to live. To appeal to her, was made\n",
      "hopeless by her having no sense of pity, even for herself. If she had\n",
      "been laid low in the streets, in any of the many encounters in which\n",
      "she had been engaged, she would not have pitied herself; nor, if she had\n",
      "been ordered to the axe to-morrow, would she have gone to it with any\n",
      "softer feeling than a fierce desire to change places with the man who\n",
      "sent her there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such a heart Madame Defarge carried under her rough robe. Carelessly\n",
      "worn, it was a becoming robe enough, in a certain weird way, and her\n",
      "dark hair looked rich under her coarse red cap. Lying hidden in her\n",
      "bosom, was a loaded pistol. Lying hidden at her waist, was a sharpened\n",
      "dagger. Thus accoutred, and walking with the confident tread of such\n",
      "a character, and with the supple freedom of a woman who had habitually\n",
      "walked in her girlhood, bare-foot and bare-legged, on the brown\n",
      "sea-sand, Madame Defarge took her way along the streets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, when the journey of the travelling coach, at that very moment\n",
      "waiting for the completion of its load, had been planned out last night,\n",
      "the difficulty of taking Miss Pross in it had much engaged Mr. Lorry’s\n",
      "attention. It was not merely desirable to avoid overloading the coach,\n",
      "but it was of the highest importance that the time occupied in examining\n",
      "it and its passengers, should be reduced to the utmost; since their\n",
      "escape might depend on the saving of only a few seconds here and there.\n",
      "Finally, he had proposed, after anxious consideration, that Miss Pross\n",
      "and Jerry, who were at liberty to leave the city, should leave it at\n",
      "three o’clock in the lightest-wheeled conveyance known to that period.\n",
      "Unencumbered with luggage, they would soon overtake the coach, and,\n",
      "passing it and preceding it on the road, would order its horses in\n",
      "advance, and greatly facilitate its progress during the precious hours\n",
      "of the night, when delay was the most to be dreaded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeing in this arrangement the hope of rendering real service in that\n",
      "pressing emergency, Miss Pross hailed it with joy. She and Jerry had\n",
      "beheld the coach start, had known who it was that Solomon brought, had\n",
      "passed some ten minutes in tortures of suspense, and were now concluding\n",
      "their arrangements to follow the coach, even as Madame Defarge,\n",
      "taking her way through the streets, now drew nearer and nearer to the\n",
      "else-deserted lodging in which they held their consultation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now what do you think, Mr. Cruncher,” said Miss Pross, whose agitation\n",
      "was so great that she could hardly speak, or stand, or move, or live:\n",
      "“what do you think of our not starting from this courtyard? Another\n",
      "carriage having already gone from here to-day, it might awaken\n",
      "suspicion.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My opinion, miss,” returned Mr. Cruncher, “is as you’re right. Likewise\n",
      "wot I’ll stand by you, right or wrong.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am so distracted with fear and hope for our precious creatures,” said\n",
      "Miss Pross, wildly crying, “that I am incapable of forming any plan. Are\n",
      "_you_ capable of forming any plan, my dear good Mr. Cruncher?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Respectin’ a future spear o’ life, miss,” returned Mr. Cruncher, “I\n",
      "hope so. Respectin’ any present use o’ this here blessed old head o’\n",
      "mine, I think not. Would you do me the favour, miss, to take notice o’\n",
      "two promises and wows wot it is my wishes fur to record in this here\n",
      "crisis?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, for gracious sake!” cried Miss Pross, still wildly crying, “record\n",
      "them at once, and get them out of the way, like an excellent man.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“First,” said Mr. Cruncher, who was all in a tremble, and who spoke with\n",
      "an ashy and solemn visage, “them poor things well out o’ this, never no\n",
      "more will I do it, never no more!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am quite sure, Mr. Cruncher,” returned Miss Pross, “that you\n",
      "never will do it again, whatever it is, and I beg you not to think it\n",
      "necessary to mention more particularly what it is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, miss,” returned Jerry, “it shall not be named to you. Second: them\n",
      "poor things well out o’ this, and never no more will I interfere with\n",
      "Mrs. Cruncher’s flopping, never no more!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Whatever housekeeping arrangement that may be,” said Miss Pross,\n",
      "striving to dry her eyes and compose herself, “I have no doubt it\n",
      "is best that Mrs. Cruncher should have it entirely under her own\n",
      "superintendence.--O my poor darlings!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I go so far as to say, miss, moreover,” proceeded Mr. Cruncher, with a\n",
      "most alarming tendency to hold forth as from a pulpit--“and let my words\n",
      "be took down and took to Mrs. Cruncher through yourself--that wot my\n",
      "opinions respectin’ flopping has undergone a change, and that wot I only\n",
      "hope with all my heart as Mrs. Cruncher may be a flopping at the present\n",
      "time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There, there, there! I hope she is, my dear man,” cried the distracted\n",
      "Miss Pross, “and I hope she finds it answering her expectations.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Forbid it,” proceeded Mr. Cruncher, with additional solemnity,\n",
      "additional slowness, and additional tendency to hold forth and hold\n",
      "out, “as anything wot I have ever said or done should be wisited on my\n",
      "earnest wishes for them poor creeturs now! Forbid it as we shouldn’t all\n",
      "flop (if it was anyways conwenient) to get ’em out o’ this here dismal\n",
      "risk! Forbid it, miss! Wot I say, for-_bid_ it!” This was Mr. Cruncher’s\n",
      "conclusion after a protracted but vain endeavour to find a better one.\n",
      "\n",
      "And still Madame Defarge, pursuing her way along the streets, came\n",
      "nearer and nearer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If we ever get back to our native land,” said Miss Pross, “you may rely\n",
      "upon my telling Mrs. Cruncher as much as I may be able to remember and\n",
      "understand of what you have so impressively said; and at all events\n",
      "you may be sure that I shall bear witness to your being thoroughly in\n",
      "earnest at this dreadful time. Now, pray let us think! My esteemed Mr.\n",
      "Cruncher, let us think!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, Madame Defarge, pursuing her way along the streets, came nearer\n",
      "and nearer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you were to go before,” said Miss Pross, “and stop the vehicle and\n",
      "horses from coming here, and were to wait somewhere for me; wouldn’t\n",
      "that be best?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Cruncher thought it might be best.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where could you wait for me?” asked Miss Pross.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Cruncher was so bewildered that he could think of no locality but\n",
      "Temple Bar. Alas! Temple Bar was hundreds of miles away, and Madame\n",
      "Defarge was drawing very near indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“By the cathedral door,” said Miss Pross. “Would it be much out of\n",
      "the way, to take me in, near the great cathedral door between the two\n",
      "towers?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, miss,” answered Mr. Cruncher.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then, like the best of men,” said Miss Pross, “go to the posting-house\n",
      "straight, and make that change.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am doubtful,” said Mr. Cruncher, hesitating and shaking his head,\n",
      "“about leaving of you, you see. We don’t know what may happen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Heaven knows we don’t,” returned Miss Pross, “but have no fear for me.\n",
      "Take me in at the cathedral, at Three o’Clock, or as near it as you can,\n",
      "and I am sure it will be better than our going from here. I feel certain\n",
      "of it. There! Bless you, Mr. Cruncher! Think-not of me, but of the lives\n",
      "that may depend on both of us!”\n",
      "\n",
      "This exordium, and Miss Pross’s two hands in quite agonised entreaty\n",
      "clasping his, decided Mr. Cruncher. With an encouraging nod or two, he\n",
      "immediately went out to alter the arrangements, and left her by herself\n",
      "to follow as she had proposed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The having originated a precaution which was already in course of\n",
      "execution, was a great relief to Miss Pross. The necessity of composing\n",
      "her appearance so that it should attract no special notice in the\n",
      "streets, was another relief. She looked at her watch, and it was twenty\n",
      "minutes past two. She had no time to lose, but must get ready at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "Afraid, in her extreme perturbation, of the loneliness of the deserted\n",
      "rooms, and of half-imagined faces peeping from behind every open door\n",
      "in them, Miss Pross got a basin of cold water and began laving her eyes,\n",
      "which were swollen and red. Haunted by her feverish apprehensions, she\n",
      "could not bear to have her sight obscured for a minute at a time by the\n",
      "dripping water, but constantly paused and looked round to see that there\n",
      "was no one watching her. In one of those pauses she recoiled and cried\n",
      "out, for she saw a figure standing in the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "The basin fell to the ground broken, and the water flowed to the feet of\n",
      "Madame Defarge. By strange stern ways, and through much staining blood,\n",
      "those feet had come to meet that water.\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Defarge looked coldly at her, and said, “The wife of Evrémonde;\n",
      "where is she?”\n",
      "\n",
      "It flashed upon Miss Pross’s mind that the doors were all standing open,\n",
      "and would suggest the flight. Her first act was to shut them. There were\n",
      "four in the room, and she shut them all. She then placed herself before\n",
      "the door of the chamber which Lucie had occupied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Defarge’s dark eyes followed her through this rapid movement,\n",
      "and rested on her when it was finished. Miss Pross had nothing beautiful\n",
      "about her; years had not tamed the wildness, or softened the grimness,\n",
      "of her appearance; but, she too was a determined woman in her different\n",
      "way, and she measured Madame Defarge with her eyes, every inch.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You might, from your appearance, be the wife of Lucifer,” said Miss\n",
      "Pross, in her breathing. “Nevertheless, you shall not get the better of\n",
      "me. I am an Englishwoman.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Defarge looked at her scornfully, but still with something of\n",
      "Miss Pross’s own perception that they two were at bay. She saw a tight,\n",
      "hard, wiry woman before her, as Mr. Lorry had seen in the same figure a\n",
      "woman with a strong hand, in the years gone by. She knew full well that\n",
      "Miss Pross was the family’s devoted friend; Miss Pross knew full well\n",
      "that Madame Defarge was the family’s malevolent enemy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“On my way yonder,” said Madame Defarge, with a slight movement of\n",
      "her hand towards the fatal spot, “where they reserve my chair and my\n",
      "knitting for me, I am come to make my compliments to her in passing. I\n",
      "wish to see her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know that your intentions are evil,” said Miss Pross, “and you may\n",
      "depend upon it, I’ll hold my own against them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Each spoke in her own language; neither understood the other’s words;\n",
      "both were very watchful, and intent to deduce from look and manner, what\n",
      "the unintelligible words meant.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It will do her no good to keep herself concealed from me at this\n",
      "moment,” said Madame Defarge. “Good patriots will know what that means.\n",
      "Let me see her. Go tell her that I wish to see her. Do you hear?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If those eyes of yours were bed-winches,” returned Miss Pross, “and I\n",
      "was an English four-poster, they shouldn’t loose a splinter of me. No,\n",
      "you wicked foreign woman; I am your match.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Defarge was not likely to follow these idiomatic remarks in\n",
      "detail; but, she so far understood them as to perceive that she was set\n",
      "at naught.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Woman imbecile and pig-like!” said Madame Defarge, frowning. “I take no\n",
      "answer from you. I demand to see her. Either tell her that I demand\n",
      "to see her, or stand out of the way of the door and let me go to her!”\n",
      " This, with an angry explanatory wave of her right arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I little thought,” said Miss Pross, “that I should ever want to\n",
      "understand your nonsensical language; but I would give all I have,\n",
      "except the clothes I wear, to know whether you suspect the truth, or any\n",
      "part of it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither of them for a single moment released the other’s eyes. Madame\n",
      "Defarge had not moved from the spot where she stood when Miss Pross\n",
      "first became aware of her; but, she now advanced one step.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am a Briton,” said Miss Pross, “I am desperate. I don’t care an\n",
      "English Twopence for myself. I know that the longer I keep you here, the\n",
      "greater hope there is for my Ladybird. I’ll not leave a handful of that\n",
      "dark hair upon your head, if you lay a finger on me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus Miss Pross, with a shake of her head and a flash of her eyes\n",
      "between every rapid sentence, and every rapid sentence a whole breath.\n",
      "Thus Miss Pross, who had never struck a blow in her life.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, her courage was of that emotional nature that it brought the\n",
      "irrepressible tears into her eyes. This was a courage that Madame\n",
      "Defarge so little comprehended as to mistake for weakness. “Ha, ha!” she\n",
      "laughed, “you poor wretch! What are you worth! I address myself to that\n",
      "Doctor.” Then she raised her voice and called out, “Citizen Doctor! Wife\n",
      "of Evrémonde! Child of Evrémonde! Any person but this miserable fool,\n",
      "answer the Citizeness Defarge!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps the following silence, perhaps some latent disclosure in the\n",
      "expression of Miss Pross’s face, perhaps a sudden misgiving apart from\n",
      "either suggestion, whispered to Madame Defarge that they were gone.\n",
      "Three of the doors she opened swiftly, and looked in.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Those rooms are all in disorder, there has been hurried packing, there\n",
      "are odds and ends upon the ground. There is no one in that room behind\n",
      "you! Let me look.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never!” said Miss Pross, who understood the request as perfectly as\n",
      "Madame Defarge understood the answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If they are not in that room, they are gone, and can be pursued and\n",
      "brought back,” said Madame Defarge to herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As long as you don’t know whether they are in that room or not, you are\n",
      "uncertain what to do,” said Miss Pross to herself; “and you shall not\n",
      "know that, if I can prevent your knowing it; and know that, or not know\n",
      "that, you shall not leave here while I can hold you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have been in the streets from the first, nothing has stopped me,\n",
      "I will tear you to pieces, but I will have you from that door,” said\n",
      "Madame Defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are alone at the top of a high house in a solitary courtyard, we are\n",
      "not likely to be heard, and I pray for bodily strength to keep you here,\n",
      "while every minute you are here is worth a hundred thousand guineas to\n",
      "my darling,” said Miss Pross.\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Defarge made at the door. Miss Pross, on the instinct of the\n",
      "moment, seized her round the waist in both her arms, and held her tight.\n",
      "It was in vain for Madame Defarge to struggle and to strike; Miss Pross,\n",
      "with the vigorous tenacity of love, always so much stronger than hate,\n",
      "clasped her tight, and even lifted her from the floor in the struggle\n",
      "that they had. The two hands of Madame Defarge buffeted and tore her\n",
      "face; but, Miss Pross, with her head down, held her round the waist, and\n",
      "clung to her with more than the hold of a drowning woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon, Madame Defarge’s hands ceased to strike, and felt at her encircled\n",
      "waist. “It is under my arm,” said Miss Pross, in smothered tones, “you\n",
      "shall not draw it. I am stronger than you, I bless Heaven for it. I hold\n",
      "you till one or other of us faints or dies!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Defarge’s hands were at her bosom. Miss Pross looked up, saw\n",
      "what it was, struck at it, struck out a flash and a crash, and stood\n",
      "alone--blinded with smoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this was in a second. As the smoke cleared, leaving an awful\n",
      "stillness, it passed out on the air, like the soul of the furious woman\n",
      "whose body lay lifeless on the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first fright and horror of her situation, Miss Pross passed the\n",
      "body as far from it as she could, and ran down the stairs to call for\n",
      "fruitless help. Happily, she bethought herself of the consequences of\n",
      "what she did, in time to check herself and go back. It was dreadful to\n",
      "go in at the door again; but, she did go in, and even went near it, to\n",
      "get the bonnet and other things that she must wear. These she put on,\n",
      "out on the staircase, first shutting and locking the door and taking\n",
      "away the key. She then sat down on the stairs a few moments to breathe\n",
      "and to cry, and then got up and hurried away.\n",
      "\n",
      "By good fortune she had a veil on her bonnet, or she could hardly have\n",
      "gone along the streets without being stopped. By good fortune, too, she\n",
      "was naturally so peculiar in appearance as not to show disfigurement\n",
      "like any other woman. She needed both advantages, for the marks of\n",
      "gripping fingers were deep in her face, and her hair was torn, and her\n",
      "dress (hastily composed with unsteady hands) was clutched and dragged a\n",
      "hundred ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "In crossing the bridge, she dropped the door key in the river. Arriving\n",
      "at the cathedral some few minutes before her escort, and waiting there,\n",
      "she thought, what if the key were already taken in a net, what if\n",
      "it were identified, what if the door were opened and the remains\n",
      "discovered, what if she were stopped at the gate, sent to prison, and\n",
      "charged with murder! In the midst of these fluttering thoughts, the\n",
      "escort appeared, took her in, and took her away.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is there any noise in the streets?” she asked him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The usual noises,” Mr. Cruncher replied; and looked surprised by the\n",
      "question and by her aspect.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t hear you,” said Miss Pross. “What do you say?”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was in vain for Mr. Cruncher to repeat what he said; Miss Pross could\n",
      "not hear him. “So I’ll nod my head,” thought Mr. Cruncher, amazed, “at\n",
      "all events she’ll see that.” And she did.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is there any noise in the streets now?” asked Miss Pross again,\n",
      "presently.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again Mr. Cruncher nodded his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t hear it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gone deaf in an hour?” said Mr. Cruncher, ruminating, with his mind\n",
      "much disturbed; “wot’s come to her?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I feel,” said Miss Pross, “as if there had been a flash and a crash,\n",
      "and that crash was the last thing I should ever hear in this life.”\n",
      "\n",

      "Along the Paris streets, the death-carts rumble, hollow and harsh. Six\n",
      "tumbrils carry the day’s wine to La Guillotine. All the devouring and\n",
      "insatiate Monsters imagined since imagination could record itself,\n",
      "are fused in the one realisation, Guillotine. And yet there is not in\n",
      "France, with its rich variety of soil and climate, a blade, a leaf,\n",
      "a root, a sprig, a peppercorn, which will grow to maturity under\n",
      "conditions more certain than those that have produced this horror. Crush\n",
      "humanity out of shape once more, under similar hammers, and it will\n",
      "twist itself into the same tortured forms. Sow the same seed of\n",
      "rapacious license and oppression over again, and it will surely yield\n",
      "the same fruit according to its kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Six tumbrils roll along the streets. Change these back again to what\n",
      "they were, thou powerful enchanter, Time, and they shall be seen to be\n",
      "the carriages of absolute monarchs, the equipages of feudal nobles, the\n",
      "toilettes of flaring Jezebels, the churches that are not my father’s\n",
      "house but dens of thieves, the huts of millions of starving peasants!\n",
      "No; the great magician who majestically works out the appointed order\n",
      "of the Creator, never reverses his transformations. “If thou be changed\n",
      "into this shape by the will of God,” say the seers to the enchanted, in\n",
      "the wise Arabian stories, “then remain so! But, if thou wear this\n",
      "form through mere passing conjuration, then resume thy former aspect!”\n",
      " Changeless and hopeless, the tumbrils roll along.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the sombre wheels of the six carts go round, they seem to plough up\n",
      "a long crooked furrow among the populace in the streets. Ridges of faces\n",
      "are thrown to this side and to that, and the ploughs go steadily onward.\n",
      "So used are the regular inhabitants of the houses to the spectacle, that\n",
      "in many windows there are no people, and in some the occupation of the\n",
      "hands is not so much as suspended, while the eyes survey the faces in\n",
      "the tumbrils. Here and there, the inmate has visitors to see the sight;\n",
      "then he points his finger, with something of the complacency of a\n",
      "curator or authorised exponent, to this cart and to this, and seems to\n",
      "tell who sat here yesterday, and who there the day before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the riders in the tumbrils, some observe these things, and all\n",
      "things on their last roadside, with an impassive stare; others, with\n",
      "a lingering interest in the ways of life and men. Some, seated with\n",
      "drooping heads, are sunk in silent despair; again, there are some so\n",
      "heedful of their looks that they cast upon the multitude such glances as\n",
      "they have seen in theatres, and in pictures. Several close their eyes,\n",
      "and think, or try to get their straying thoughts together. Only one, and\n",
      "he a miserable creature, of a crazed aspect, is so shattered and made\n",
      "drunk by horror, that he sings, and tries to dance. Not one of the whole\n",
      "number appeals by look or gesture, to the pity of the people.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a guard of sundry horsemen riding abreast of the tumbrils,\n",
      "and faces are often turned up to some of them, and they are asked some\n",
      "question. It would seem to be always the same question, for, it is\n",
      "always followed by a press of people towards the third cart. The\n",
      "horsemen abreast of that cart, frequently point out one man in it with\n",
      "their swords. The leading curiosity is, to know which is he; he stands\n",
      "at the back of the tumbril with his head bent down, to converse with a\n",
      "mere girl who sits on the side of the cart, and holds his hand. He has\n",
      "no curiosity or care for the scene about him, and always speaks to the\n",
      "girl. Here and there in the long street of St. Honore, cries are raised\n",
      "against him. If they move him at all, it is only to a quiet smile, as he\n",
      "shakes his hair a little more loosely about his face. He cannot easily\n",
      "touch his face, his arms being bound.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the steps of a church, awaiting the coming-up of the tumbrils, stands\n",
      "the Spy and prison-sheep. He looks into the first of them: not there.\n",
      "He looks into the second: not there. He already asks himself, “Has he\n",
      "sacrificed me?” when his face clears, as he looks into the third.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Which is Evrémonde?” says a man behind him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That. At the back there.”\n",

      "The clocks are on the stroke of three, and the furrow ploughed among the\n",

      "end. The ridges thrown to this side and to that, now crumble in and\n",
      "close behind the last plough as it passes on, for all are following\n",
      "to the Guillotine. In front of it, seated in chairs, as in a garden of\n",
      "public diversion, are a number of women, busily knitting. On one of the\n",
      "fore-most chairs, stands The Vengeance, looking about for her friend.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Ay! Louder, Vengeance, much louder, and still she will scarcely hear\n",
      "thee. Louder yet, Vengeance, with a little oath or so added, and yet\n",
      "it will hardly bring her. Send other women up and down to seek her,\n",
      "lingering somewhere; and yet, although the messengers have done dread\n",
      "deeds, it is questionable whether of their own wills they will go far\n",
      "enough to find her!\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bad Fortune!” cries The Vengeance, stamping her foot in the chair, “and\n",
      "here are the tumbrils! And Evrémonde will be despatched in a wink, and\n",
      "she not here! See her knitting in my hand, and her empty chair ready for\n",
      "her. I cry with vexation and disappointment!”\n",
      "\n",
      "As The Vengeance descends from her elevation to do it, the tumbrils\n",

      "The supposed Evrémonde descends, and the seamstress is lifted out next\n",
      "after him. He has not relinquished her patient hand in getting out, but\n",
      "still holds it as he promised. He gently places her with her back to the\n",
      "crashing engine that constantly whirrs up and falls, and she looks into\n",
